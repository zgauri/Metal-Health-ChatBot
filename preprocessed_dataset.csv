riding an electric scooter the last 100 yards to my hotel i used the free uber jump electric scooters while on a business trip this weekend hotel was a mile or so from the riverwalk and rather than uber cab or walk i thought i would take advantage of the free promo uber was running on their jump scooters first time was awesome opened the app scanned zipped back to the hotel in no time next day i grab another one showed a half charge and i scan and jump on works fine for a minute or two and then went into turtle mode im going like 2 mph snails are calling on your left and laughing at me end the ride and grab another scooter works for a few minutes and then turtle mode sigh i swap again file a help mode complaint and try a third this one mostly works and i finally get where i am going that night going from one event to another i decide to be lazy and rent another scooter everything is working fine until i try to end the ride there is an error and now uber thinks i am somewhere in africa close and reopen the app a few times try calling and file a complaint after 5 minutes of messing with it the ride finally ends im not drinking alcohol at any point because a i have a screwed up throat which is a whole other tifu saved me life type story and b trying to lose weight later that morning after the event is over i grab the required whataburger late night early am meal when i leave i try and find a scooter which previously had been easier to find than outrage on tumblr none to be found i do find a few of the bikes but none of them will even turn on my battery is low so i dont want to try and download another app i decide to suck it up and just walk back towards the hotel this sucks but oh well i figure i will find one on the way no jumpuber scooters to be found lots of red razor scooters which look just like the uberjump scooters several bikes which wont turn on to sync up and be scannedused i walk almost all the way back to the hotel im maybe 100200 yards from the hotel when i see the holy grail of a jump scooter my feet hurt im tired and strangely excited to use the scooter for that last push scan and everything syncs up and the scooter activates hooray right the damn thing starts to work and then turtles as i am crossing the i35 access road and then proceeds to take off like the infamous darwin awards jato rocket car until the wheels lock for a second and i prove newtons first law of motion still works at 3 in the morning i go flying and even though i get my hands out in front of me proceed to face plant into the cement i feel my front teeth crack apart my glasses go flying and my nose looks like the aftermath of a mma fight im laying there bleeding on the sidewalk and thinking that the old irish blessing of may the road rise up to meet you is a curse i get up resist the urge to hurl the death scooter into the first dumpster i can find i hobble back to the hotel where the front desk immediately calls an ambulance im bleeding everywhere and get a good look at my busted grill and nose lovely the hotel was great they charged my phone and let me call jumpuber they ask if ive gotten medical attention and ask if i have filed a police report they seemed much more concerned with the latter than the former they tell me they have escalated my case and they will get back to me when the team is back in paramedics and fire department shows up while i was tempted i didnt burn the scooter they ask me a few questions tell me that the scooters are the work of the devil and they have seen a ton of accidents and taken people to the emergency room they also tell me that i am probably screwed as the fine print says i accept all liability before riding the paramedics tell me that i am probably ok and that if i go to the er they will just check my vitals and send me home they tell me that if they check my vitals i will be charged and that i probably dont need it and it would be a waste of money awesome they advise some ibuprofen and seeing my doctor a dentist and filing a police report i thank them and call the police and then call the jump team again i try and get advice on what i should do and get the corporate i cant tell you what to do but the case has been escalated police officer writes the report and tells me again hes seen nothing but problems from the scooters i specifically ask him to give me a field sobriety test or a breathalyzer to try and make sure i have some way to prove i am in no way impaired he says he cant but he can tell im not after all of this im exhausted and covered in blood with a busted nose and two broken teeth the hotel gives me some motrin ice and water i go back to the room scrub up and take the meds today i get to go see how bad the dental work will be and how much out of pocket i will be once again crappy luck shuts down the nintendo switch or xbox one i was planning on getting tldr staying at a hotel off the riverwalk 9600 using an uberjump scooter free ruined leather jacket 200 bloody scratched up glasses 300 paramedics bill even though i refused treatment and didnt call them 500 messed up hip dental work 23k proving newtons first law of motion with my face priceless,0

falling asleep on a long school trip so ive been on a grueling 3day trip with a bunch of kids from my grade touring different colleges and today is the final day were getting back home at around midnight so im tired af literally sleep wasnt exactly something you do when roomed in a hotel with your friends anyway as i said earlier were heading home rn its like a 7 hour drive and since im tired i decide to sleep didnt think much of it i wake up find out were about to drive into a burger king nothing special and then i check my snap to see multiple friends of mine sent me videos of the absolutely oof way i fell asleep my legs were sprawled out my head completely up to towards ceiling mouth wide open it was bad my panic slowly crescendos as i watch even more and more friends tell me about the way i was sleeping just making jokes about it and all that it got worse when i started hearing other students that i dont talk to talking about a dude that looked funny while he was sleeping neato it gets worse after all of the realising everyone was nonchalantly making fun of my sleeping position i realised my literal ex was sitting less than a foot away from me yee yee kiddos oof its been kind of a petty anger towards each other for about 2 years now so i know she had to have taken pictures and probably sent them to other people so thats my story thanks for listening tldr i fell asleep looking like an idiot and literally everyone noticed it including my ex,0
my friends are all hanging out without me after we intended to hang out tonight its the first day of summer and we had plans to hang out and they all got together without me with some other friends who i also tried to hang out with and they said they were busy life is good s,0
suicide being logicalfirst of all apologies for my english didnt really speek it since i graduated from school last year does anyone know the idea of suicide being kind of logical when its like the only reasonable way of thinking about your future since ive gratuaded from school last year i tried to work in a supermarket and started to study a subject which i really liked at that time started with my drivers licence too first i stopped working because i got more nervous and tired at the same time with every shift then i skipped more and more classes at my university and eventually stopped going there at all around that time i got my drivers licence but due to me being nervous i never got to drive that much to get some practice i basically cut off every duty that forced me to leave the house and interact with people and therefore it developed into a cicle and my anxiety souds kind of weird to use this term but i cant find a better description of being extremely worried about everyone and everything and having no energy to do something about it at the same time got even worse now im starting to meet friends more often again and i made up a plan of other classes i could visit at my university eg to change subjects but now ive got chest pain which makes it nearly impossible to work out and my motivation for visiting other classes slowly fades away im more and more aware of the fact that everything i put my energy into basically goes to shit in the end no progress in working out still not a sign of social skills or self respect though i try to interact with friends or even strangers as much as possible i think i let my parents down every time i dont have the energy andor courage to do something important although they seem to be interested and understanding theyre both extremely stressed at the time never had a girlfriend at the age of 19 had this whatever it was with a girl for about 15 years in the end she was just disappointed and i was hurt and felt kind of used regular problems of a regular person especially considering my age but i feel like im simply to weak to live with it let alone do anything about it to be honest i just cant see me overcoming those fears or problems in the near future finding a subject im interested in get a nice body lose my fearstress about everythingeveryone get a healthy relationship i just cant imagine me being capable of solving any of these problems i may sound like an extreme coward atleast thats what i think it seems like but before i hurtdisappoint anyone else or get hurtdisappointed mostly by myself once again i think it would be the best and in this case most logical way to just end it when theres no sign of something getting better in the near future im not even whiny or overemotional at this point which im often enough believe me it just sounds like the least annoyingstressful way to solve all my problems at once,1
endin my shitall my life ive been guilt tripped by both parents and i didnt even know its super draining waking up in the morning and getting shit because im not smart like my brothers are or being told to leave everyone alone because im annoying i was constantly told i was the reason why they fight and they would somehow they would always get my other siblings to add onto giving me shit with them and now ive had enough im tired of them controlling how i feel and how i live but theres really nothing else i can do im not legally able to leave my parents and live by myself cuz im not old enough and so im just gonna take some of those sleeping pills and wish for the best no more getting told that im an idiot no more of hearing them argue about stupid bullshit that only inflate their egos no more fucking stress,1
i just realized that im in love with my female friend so me and this girl have been hanging out for quite a while now weve always gotten along really well weve literally been spending our entire weekends together for the better part of a year now when ever i hung out with her i seemed to forget all of my problems life got less boring and i seemed to smile more for the last 3 months ive been away from her and its made me realize that i love her this past month i told her about my feelings for her and we literally havent been able to keep out hands off each other heres a cute picture i took of her yesterday that she gave me permission to post url,0
my 25f married boss 37m had an affair with me is threatening me this is a doozy ill try and sum it up i already know ive made terrible decisions 2019 and ive been feeling the guilt for days so no need to let me have it im more curious what i now have to do in this situation and im relying on yall for better perspective 4 months ago i was messaged by current boss lets call him todd on a networking site saying he wanted to bring me on in restaurant management this is a place that is franchised and i go regularly as does my family to this location hes the head chef i was hired throughout the 4 months he steadily flirted with me always touching me making comments i never thought anything of it as he does it to anyone and hes married todd continually texted me outside of work when i wouldnt respond id get a really or some comment about how long it took me the job promised promotions and felt as though it was going nowhere todd approached me one day after work for a drink at the bar which was normal he offered to drive me home and immediately started rubbing my leg trying to kiss my hand he was charming and i knew it was completely wrong somehow we stated kissing and then i backed off asked him what he was doing i said youre married he looked disappointed somehow that i knew this and maybe thought i didnt i asked if he had an open relationship he said no he asked if he said he could come inside i said i wasnt comfortable with it and had no idea what he wanted the job was going nowhere and i felt i was hired by todd as his amusement because he liked my photo this was a place i enjoyed being at though however i felt super uncomfortable returning so i gave my notice the next day hadnt returned since or really talk to him after i got a text the next week and we both stupidly drunkenly met up at his house actually their house i knew it was terrible and stupid and somehow went anyway i know that night i almost felt sympathy because he said how unhappy he was and would just stare and me and say how wished it was me and life was unfair if he could trade places he would he wanted to change his situation and wished i was his girl instead blah blah i didnt ask him any questions or ask him to say any of this but it felt like he was just confiding in me i simply responded that id meet him where he was at with this it felt like he genuinely confessed something to me here it goes the next week i heard nothing from todd when hes always texting me i said we should meet and talk he said theres nothing to talk about i said we should just go over it he said its not complicated dont over think it dating a married man isnt complicated okay he kept ignoring me the next week i finally called and said if he feels like this im not just a booty call and it wouldve been nice to hear from him he totally shut down and responded by saying he has no time for me and kept yelling at me saying i expect answers like im in 12th grade and to get over it he then messaged me saying he felt sick to his stomach and i deserved the world i couldnt keep up and im still confused rn tbh he sent me a text just now saying something like hes going to block my number if i ever contact him if i ever see him again if i ever go to his place of work he has friends and cousins who are members of the police and he will contact his friends this is a place i visited worked had parties at im still owed money from the bar i feel like im being harassed and threatened into never showing up again when he has no grounds to do this he has only worked there 8 months i did for 4 of them its like i was just hired as amusement and used ive accepted we both obviously made bad choices here but now its like im being silenced and harassed i think hes just afraid of his wife knowing obviously im not sure how to approach this or even how to return to this place for my money or parties as usual as the other woman ive been feeling like absolute shit and would the wife even want to know any advice is welcome tldr married boss hired me and hit on me and we hooked up i quit and am still owed money from work and hes threatening me into never returning,0

killing myself tonightim very thankful for the kind words on my last post you guys managed to keep me alive for 2 days but ivr been crying my eyes out since this morning and i realized i really and truly cant live with the never ending constant pain so i do indeed have to kill myself tonight all your kind words were greatly appreciated mental illness is the absolute fucking worst it kills you wishing that someone suffers with mental illness is even worse than wishing death on someone wishing death on someone that person just has to die but mental illness kills you every single day its like your mind is constantly torturing you i wrote individual letters to people and im going to put them in my mail box because my family checks the mail box everyday i dont want a note right next to me,1
ive reached that point in my adulthood where i can no longer sleep in im 21 now so i know im not old at all but when i was at least 2 or 3 years younger i can sleep all the way til noon on a weekend especially at this point where im not in school for the summer but now since over the past couple years of waking up at 730 am to get ready for work ive managed to adapt to waking up at the first glimpse of sunlight and my body is ready for the rest of the day on the bright side i have no need for an alarm clock last night i stayed up late knowing i want to sleep for at least a couple extra hours compared to usual since im off on weekends substitute teacher perks i spent the night out and came home at about midnight and fell asleep around 200 am at least i can make it to the gym in the early hours now,0

tifu by getting the police to smash the neighbours front door down i have new neighbours we didnt really get off to a good start we introduced ourself when we saw them half way down the street once but we realised they were mid domestic argument so walked away as it was pretty awkward since then they never said anything to us and sometimes we all arrive home at the same time and its a race to see who can get there door open faster in order not to have to acknowledge each other i should mention they have a dog theyre out a lot and we never hear the dog apart from the sporadic bark however tonight for over an hour the dog was howling a constant high pitched howl that sounded like he was hurt there lights were on so i figured they were home dog is still whimpering and howling and i hear what sounds like a female screaming i am now convinced the lady next door is hurt and the dog howling at her side i knock on her door a couple of times but no answer my partner calls the police and they turn up i tell them im worried they have a look through the window and said the place looks ransacked then they just booted the door down completely of its hinges glass everywhere and guess what theyre not in the dog was just missing its owners and they live in a mess created by them its going to be even more awkward from now on,0

what are the common reasons for your friendships not working out for me i can no longer invest in a friend when im putting in the majority of the effort in upholding that connection i can no longer stay patient with a friend who cannot hold onto the awareness of my needs i can no longer have my time wasted due to a friends carelessness to being late more than an acceptable length of time or canceling on me very last minute on important dates i know what i bring to the table not going to continue wasting my energy time and compassion for someone to just take so much and not give back nearly enough im tired of people promising me the possibilities of their friendship only to flake and be selfish thats my curse i have expectations of others because i hold myself up to those same expectations i want to give so much and wish to receive almost as much i can be reasonable oh well,0

ruining santa for a little girl so like most of these this took place 2 years ago the day after christmas my girlfriend at the time had some good friends that just happened to have a young daughter i think she was about 10 or 11 they had came over to play cards and to visit my girlfriend and i lived in california but were in another state for christmas and visiting her family and friends the night had pretty much gone crappy before this so everyone was in a pretty bad mood anyway we were playing cards and talking about christmas and past christmases and i had just kinda assumed they had spoken to their daughter about santa like i said she was 11 or 12 and i found out about santa when i was 8 without missing a beat i looked at my girlfriends friends husband and said the unthinkable what age did you guys tell a that there was no santa and how did she react in a joking matter then next few minutes are kind of a blur but i seem to remember being slapped upside my face by my ex and her screaming they havent told her yet i look around at the parents who are now mortified and staring at methe mom kinda sighs and puts her head downi look over at the dad and hes fuming we were actually kinda good friends before this and lastly i look over at the girl she was balling but that kinda confused cry after awhile it turned into a sob and she quietly said i kind of knew it all my friends at school would tell me that their parents bought them stuff and i always wondered why no one mentioned santa the mom quietly said its complicated but he is real and well have a long conversation about this on the way home they got up and left 2 months later my girlfriend broke up with me and i never saw any of them again lol tldr ruined santa for a little girl a few years ago the day after christmas but in my defense she was 11 and should have known already,0

i 20m have never been in a relationship and im unsure about my feelings towards a girl i think i like 20f ive known this girl for a good 5 years now and weve been pretty close never really the closest of friends but weve always had a lot to do with each other in hindsight and i would like to give myself the biggest facepalm i think she liked me a long time ago just as an example we were on a school trip she grabbed my hand ran down a hill and gave me a huge hug then was super close the whole night i dont know whats wrong with me but i never said anything and ive actually always wanted to ask her about that as a second example we went to a restuarant shared pizza and a supershake then held hands all the way to the train okay so they were a few years ago and they are the most extreme examples but the fact that i let them slide as her being nice is the source of my worries today we had a quiet time of not really talking much after high school but now were back at being awesome friends and i dont want to miss an opportunity like i did in the past she messages me a fair amount with some thrown in and when we call she giggles a lot which always makes me so damn happy anyway we sometimes hike or see a movie and last week we went to a party then afterwards bought 24 nuggets and sat it in car for 2 hours after midnight just chatting before sleeping at her house did i stupidly miss another blindingly obvious opportunity i feel like i did the thing is she is super nice to everyone and can be flirty with most friends so im still erring on the side of shes just being friendly and thats it one friend i talked to about it said that if they didnt know any better theyd think we had a relationship another said theyve wanted us to be a thing for ages and i should bite the bullet and give it a shot as a bonus she must talk about my work situation a bit because her dad offered me a job and has been nothing but the kindest to me he called me last night to chat about work and we had a sort of fatherson talk for over an hour it was very welcome but unexpected too their whole family seems really fond of me and always has been come to think about it i feel like i want to ask her out but im maybe being held back by a few things one being that she is an awesome friend and i am comfortable with things as they are being new to relationships i dont know how or when to make the next step or if i even should second is that id hate to lose this opportunity to work for her dad though i doubt that would happen id also have no idea what to do in a relationship so i guess im asking as a newbie here am i in a position to ask if she likes me and how on earth do i manage it i am scared out of my mind at the thought of it to be honest so any advice would be awesome tldr new to relationships unsure about how to go about a relationship with girl i like or even if im reading the signs correctly brain is going a million miles an hour and would love some advice from someone who knows what theyre talking about haha,0
going to bed hungry tonight hows everyone elses thanksgiving im 15 and my dad is too drunk to function and my mom is having a bipolar breakdown and the worst part is the fridge is empty i cant even make myself a thanksgiving dinner on a brighter note tho i found out my crush likes me today so something to look forward too i guess,0
sending a mothers day card ill try to make this quick my mom has been having a rough time lately so i wanted to do something really nice for her for mothers day even though i wont be home since im away at school so i found an ad for a 30 mothers day card through instagram and when opened it pops open with hearts on a tree and stuff its really nice and unique i thought so i bought and sent that with a long thoughtful message that was from the heart the message was along the lines of she does many little things that she may think goes unnoticed but i truly appreciate everything shes done for me no matter how minor long story short i forgot to sign any names and she sent a essay long thank you saying how unique and pretty the card was and how thoughtful it was and how as soon as she got home and opened the card she was filled with happiness the message was basically really nice and involving plenty of heart emojis she sent that to my sister who is also away at law school but she didnt message or call me at all which im fine with just as long as she is happy i told my sister to just go along with it so it wouldnt ruin the effect or anything by saying oh btw it wasnt me who sent that next time ill sign my name also i kinda just forgot or assumed she would know who its from just thought this was funny like a curb your enthusiasm episode tldr i sent a mothers day card to mom i bought and sent it from college and forgot to add a clear indication of who its from my sister got all the thanks and we just laughed about it like its from a curb your enthusiasm episode,0

seeing which autotyped post my phone makes is the best part three right row uh that i would not really hurt or not because im and i are going out for some people that have a uh mind i guess they have just been really nice for me something really cool is cool cool uh but its a cool i and it really really nice you have really fun like or i but it would just kinda cool cool game and its really nice you dont really even want me playing the sun i guess it would also like or you want me to play with the dancing but its a good and the only one i is that i dont know but i cant play anymore because i cant really listen and i and it doesnt work anymore its really annoying when you have a few minutes and you have just a lot to play and then youre just trying and you want a little more than what it says on it you dont have a game like but you cant even rhyme and stuff or anything else and stuff that makes me you feel stupid but you cant read ur bored it just keeps crashing pls daily fix please please fix the sun it but the app keeps me from a lot to my screen and the screen and i dont have it in the app and then just a little guy that doesnt really like but its really nice i cant even download this game its a cool it really really nice and its cool fun it would also like or ur mum or a friend and a little while it but is fun it but the best game in the background its fun i dont even know what to play with the others it like but its still kinda like or i hate old games like but its still a virgin it makes it easy and easy but it kinda like or the same way you know how much fun play and i ur friends like but it kinda boring,0

alone on vday changing perspective on this fake holiday im hanging with my and reading reddit not ideal for the dayvday but it is what it is i choose not to let this day be more than what it isthursdayus i think that today can be hard for both singles and nonsingles for single people there is the glaring reminders everywhere in stores tv ads people walking who show more pda during this time that you are alone especially if you are newly single it stings harder for couples theres added pressures about what to buy and how much to spend how much to do for the person depending on status time and feelings money etc pressure for proposals jewelry and flowers then for both s ns the dreaded office flower deliveries if youre single well you know if youre in a relationship of any type it can make feel sad seeing other coworkers getting them when you dont for men it can make you feel guilty if you didnt get any forgot or cant afford to because jesus h christ roses are stupid expensive and they die i admit theyre beautiful and i wouldnt turn them down but for 200 id rather buy a nice handbag i really wish this fake holiday was never created i think it would save a lot of heartache also a few relationships too but its here and i cant change that but i can change is how i see it instead of feeling sorry for myself i buy myself a nice big box of chocolates ive ever before treated myself to flowers not at work of course but even if some find this pathetic i find it much more enjoyable and it makes me happy on a day that otherwise could make me feel like shit thats just my two cents tldr im ok wbeing alone on vday i think this day can be hard for everyone feeling alone newly single sting couples wissues re no gifts forgot the day expecting proposals or jewelry its a hard day wexpectations built around a fake holiday i wish never existed could have saved some relationships and single people feeling even more alone just my two cents,0

testing out a photo booth this tifu happened the weekend and this is a throwaway because friends and family i work for a company as a media it guy i have been working on a project at home for a company event basically designing a bespoke photo booth for events and having photos printed out and shown across digital screens as well well i was at home testing out the green screen and whatnot and my girlfriend was like lets have a go as she was dressed up in a rather nice looking batgirl outfit so we started doing normal photos and then progressed into rather revealing photos and turning out to be a rather fun evening the photos got printed off automatically to the built in printer then went to bed i then get a message from my boss in the morning informing me of a meeting and ended with a rather random bat emoji on the message just thought i it was a typo i get into the meeting room and my boss is there my boss then says we have someone else joining us and proceeded to say please send in bruce wayne on the phone and then in comes my supervisor dressed as bloody batman thats when the penny dropped turns out while me and the girlfriend where getting busy in the photo booth it was live streaming images to the screens in the office as we took photos because of the vpn i had enables on the built in pc while my boss was in the office on the weekend with my supervisor doing project work im sat there just gobsmacked and shocked suddenly everyone laughs and thanked me for testing the project im then presented with a gift basket because im going to have to let the girlfriend know she knows my work lot very well and burst out laughing when i told her nothing is going to happen at work which is good they just wanted to have fun with me for a bit but have been advised to not be that stupid again the storage unit has been securely erased i now join the wall of shame at work for dumb crap done when testing projects tldr tasked with building a photo booth tested it with the girlfriend and accidentally live streaming photos to the office lab tvs,0
suicide is not the answer i posted here this morning talking about how ive not been coping well and how ive thought about suicide but not being sure if id do it well suicide is not the answer i completely understand how hard it is to try to carry on but whether you feel like you have got anything to live for or whether you feel like you have got nothing there is always someone somewhere whos life would be worse off without you in it maybe you havent found that person yet but you might meet that person tomorrow or next week or in a years time be excited about the future you never know what is around the corner you might have to struggle a bit more before you get to where you want to be in life but that struggle will only make you stronger and it will be completely worth it it might seem easy for me to say this because ive never even attempted suicide but i have thought about it a lot recently but i do know how hard life can be and it seems like sometimes no matter what people say it seems like things will never get better but if you really want it then they will there will always be someone who loves and cares about you and will be there for you no matter what stay strong were all in this together,1
friendship finally ended of 8yrs now they are talking about suicide text in posti truly wish i could explain every little detail of this from beginning to end so that i can paint a clear picture because this friendship has been a very very complicated one the best i can do is think of all the cliff notes and put them down as i think of them warning this is probably gonna be a loooooong read but i feel all the info is needed to paint a clear picture because life is complicated and cant be black and white also i will have the full text she sent me at the very bottom she has multiple mental issues depression being a big one for the past year we have been fwb she loves me but i dont feel the same trust me we have talked into detail and she knows ill never want to be with her she treats our friendship like we are in a relationship this is the big kicker to me just ending this friendship outright she has talked about cutting and has cut herself many times she has talked about suicide but as far as taking pills hasnt ever fully committed as she says she cares to much about her pets having no one to take care of them 4 ferrets and 3 cats she lives in what could only be explained a shack with a drunkmeth head father she is pretty much homeless but works for amazon as a driver i truly have tried to be there for her and help her as best i can emotionally and truly am able to blame myself for not being able to deal with her anymore i ended the toxic friendship sadly the only way it could have ended our friendship has almost ended several times already but neither of us went through with it in the end after i guess talking it out how i ended it was being very distant only saying pretty much the same thing of its you now leave me alone please refer to next points about this as i knew the only way this friendship was going to end was for her to hate me i have tried my best as a friend to be there for her as best i can it feels like it was never good enough she would always apologize for acting a certain way yelling getting mad at me insulting me but if i did anything wrong i would essentially be verbally abusedinsulted until i take blame essentially again it fell like she wanted to be there for her like the equivalent of a boyfriend everyweek for a bit over a year i dedicated one whole day to hangout with her and another day after work and i would stay with her till 10pm i am not going to say i was perfect in this friendship but if i was not answering a text within 10 minutes of her sending or if i did not text back because there was nothing added to the conversation to actually keep it going i would always get answers back that were along the lines of actual texts by the way it doesnt matter you dont give a shit anyway there are so many things you just havent answered and i have given up trying to get answers from you because i know to you the question means nothing which is why i didnt get an answer im going to go die now should i be apologizing goodnight i guess its obvious enough that you dont wanna talk to me i feel like i should just leave you alone forever and you would be a lot happier is that what i should do she talks to me about her dreams a lot almost always featuring me our sex was ungodly amounts of good like i am sure would make everyone jealous good and probably will never have sex that good ever again but that was not even a single reason why i stayed friends with her though she now thinks otherwise and has in the past sayjng i used her as a cumdumpster i have told her and truly ment that i understand to some capacity her mental issues i listened to a podcast on mental illness that finally made it click for me and it was insane no amount of videos articles that i read ever made sense to me bu this one finally did it if i missed a question that she asked me while i was at work and i somehow missed it or never answered instead of asking it again i was told to find it or i got this kind of text no but its fine i just double checked you never answered my last question monday which was a curiosity question i almost always would head over her house if she had a bad day on her birthday i stayed the night with her cuddling as we slept as i always declined sleeping in the same bedstaying the night i wanted to make it clear that it was out of friendship my hugs always made her feel better me being around always made her feel better i didnt have to talk to make her feel better as long as i was there holding her i was pretty much her rock i was finally mentally broken down from being put down over and over again if i was not this perfect friend she wanted me to be it feels like if she was having a rough day she would essentially want me to just say something rather then nothing but i cant just do that i cant think of what to say half the time and if i try to say something ot felt like the wrong thing and if i dont it was the wrong thing we have discussed this before my brain is racked right now ill add more as i think of them the text since i know you blocked me i figured i should just say this anyway maybe one day youll go into your blocked messages i have decided not going to live anymore i have decided on how im going to do it so hopefully by this time next week i will be dead i dont know how to live in this world without you anymore i just cant do it if im successful like i think i will be just know you mean everything to me i was holding on because of you all the support in the world couldnt help me once you left youll be getting a gift from me and ill be making sure you get your game back with some weed for the future the gift will prob arrive after im already gone im sorry i couldnt have done more and im sorry i couldnt be strong enough without you i would always miss you goodbye my person my bestfriend heart and soul,1

maybe i suffer from something called visual stress maybe its just procrastination getting the better of me so today i was on my laptop procrastinating on reddit just doing whatever when i decided to sit down and actually do some work that didnt last long a small block of text into what i was doing i was having a hard time reading this thing harder than normal i start thinking about that then about why its hard to read theres a whole load of small environmental factors i notice a bunch of things its kinda cold im tired thirsty theres a glare which means i have to turn up the brightness of the laptop then i realise thats not the only thing text is just hard to read especially black text like its practically moving then im like should it be acting like that so i turn to google try to describe what the text is doing to the best of my ability shimmering search results are in ocular migrain no make text shimmer in css nope but thats cool so ill bookmark that for later visual stress hmm whats this maybe lets have a look i clicked onto possibly thee most difficult to read web page i have ever laid my eyes on light blue bold comic sans to appeal to children parents this page mentions movement and jumping and a few other things about text but tbh no shimmering like how id describe it another much more normal and easier to read website on visual stress tells me all the things about text but also says people have trouble interpreting stairs or something and they see colors and straight edges move and probably acid drops are a thing or something because its sound like people be tripping with this issue so then i forget about it and frantically finish what i was doing later that day yet again im procrastinating it pops into my mind again so i google a test and to be fair this is probably the only website on this topic that put any thought into the design of the website to actually accommodate someone with difficulty reading and better yet is also a knowledge that adults may be looking for answers so i did the test but honestly i dont have a clue i just wanna know is it normal for text to shimmer when your reading and now suddenly its way easier to i read with a celery overlay on text but is this actually something wrong with me is this a dysfunction or just something that everyone experiences and some just experience it more significantly than others like their brain has a higher iso or something for all you photography nerds that may be reading or not reading id like to believe everyone has this to some degree but then why is it so hard to find it on google theres usually all sorts of weird nonsense on google what are your guyss thoughts and yes i think i am procrastinating too much,0
i just noticed side cut bangs have gone out of style for the majority of women and girls now i mostly see straight cut bangs or their hair parted mostly or maybe i just dont go outside enough to actually observe i still have my bangs like this and my speculation would be because the elaborate instagram style shows off all the makeup on their face like the kardashians and kylie jenner do anyone else also notice this lol,0

getting a vasectomy and jumping the gun before we talk testicles lets talk teeth what do teeth and testes have in common you ask novocain apparently since this incident i read that some folks namely gingers me require more novocain than other people andor require more wait time i recall every cavity filling requiring an additional shot however the dentist always performed a preprod check with his instrument patient comfort it seems to be a thing so the decision came after years of my children bag balming their heads glitter bombing oscillating fans and baby powdering living rooms a vasectomy was in order i should preface by saying im not tough i dont like needles discussing blood or surgeries in fact when folks tell me they are having a procedure and i must relay that story 1 i dont listen 2 its relayed as a they broke their clavicle b surgeon will be performing a hysterectomy dont ask me why its the only medical vocabulary i know and retain they dont let me fill out employee absentee reports anymore at the office either ok so we are all in agreement not only am i not tough im also an idiot back to the story doctor walks in upon the exchange of pleasantries i notice this gentleman is crosseyed nothing against crosseyed folks but if you pick your profession as a surgeon understand thats an uphill battle regardless his heavy accent woos me over german swedish i dunno by now im intrigued by the dodgy eye and a voice in the back of my head says challenge accepted he said some other stuff but honestly i didnt understand and wasnt really listening i do recall him mentioning a drug to take presurgery valium which will help calm the nerves yes i take the valium 1hr as prescribed prior to surgery im anxiously tapping my feet in the waiting room hoping the valium will kick in or my name wont be called next sean like a dog at the vet im dragged by my collar into the room and they get to work with the novocain this im told is the worst part so i brace and feel a pinch then another pinch for the second side immediately he grabs the knife and begins to cut side 1 a wave of pain i cannot describe floods my body as im disemboweled and burned without any hint of novocain or valium in sight a magnitude of betrayal only envisioned in braveheart as sir william wallace is tortured and stretched i long for my kilt as i scream freeeeedom to the other helpless lads in the waiting room doctor ok next side the pain is reenacted but im not sure if im on the border of fainting or the valium has kicked in but all i can do is take shallow breaths and sweat profusely as im stitched back up nurse you dont look so good i shake my head why dont you lay here and rest i nod doctor begins to wash up and head out i ask whats whats the process here when can i expect results now im pretty sure i heard youll need two weeks and minimum twentyfive deposits before your first test youll definitely want to rest for the first week week 1 ice drugs and walking like john wayne week 2 i stare down at my stitched and bruised remains at this point if youve ever switched on a breaker after performing a substandard wiring reassembly put questionable foilpaper in the microwave or given a second flush at a clogged toilet you have a fraction of understanding whats going on in my mind willthiswork hallelujah for those of you calculating the race numbers its going to require 3 wins each weekday and 5 wins each day over the weekend in order to place in the poles doctors orders luckily wife will be out of town thursday through sunday so this will be less stressful without a crew chief queue soundtrack eye of the tiger x24 lets just say worst week ever wife returns home how were the kids great i think looking at me puzzled made me realize how appropriate a vasectomy really was so i got good news monday i can get tested monday tomorrow i thought doctor said 25 i explained what the doctor said that cant be right ask them tomorrow when you drop off results so heres the deal when dropping off soldier results you have 1 hr to get them there so that means youre running into a hospital with outstretched arms holding a paper bag im not sure what prompts the security guards to tackle you but apparently thats not one of them i ask the lady who is really surprised to see me whats the deal here ummm you are supposed to wait at least 1 month and have at least 25 ejaculations youre 2 weeks too early tldr i got a vasectomy without novocain then proceeded to speed up the normal breakin procedure in double the time,0

what do you think he m27 thinks i f23 think super lengthy post so click off if you dont want to read it rather than complaining about how long it is in the comments but i really need advice and opinions badly please read the whole thing i met a man several months ago on a dating app he was kind and sweet we spoke for a month before we met up i was really busy with exams and work i wasnt expecting him to wait that long but he did we texted and snapchatted a ton but didnt speak on the phone cuz he didnt like phone callswhich was fine both of us were looking for something casual and a no strings attached situation after coming out of serious relationships i told him i didnt want to drop my pants for someone the first time i meet them so i wont be having sex the first time he was completely fine with that when we finally met up we had such a great time we got along great and made out tons he didnt want the date to end so i did go back to his place but we just rolled around in bed basically dry humping and making out hes a guy thats slept with a lot of women i could tell he knows how to please a woman too again we both wanted a very casual nsa thing before we met but spoke a lot he told me he was falling for me ummm that hed be my date to a fam wedding of mine that i should go to his cottage over the summer with him and his friends etc also during the date when i went to his house i met his friends and he gave me a tour of his whole house he was proud of building he was talking about his godson and how one day ill meet him too after the date we still spoke but not to the extent we use to wed still talk every day though hed mostly initiate it i was busy again whenever he wanted to meet up and this time he wanted to meet for sex and hanging out which was understandable i know i was being shitty here by being too busy but i did have a lot going on and it was a very tough time in my life plus i felt fuck buddies didnt need to meet all the time about 2 weeks after our first date i asked if he was down for drink that following friday or thursday night he said he was busy with school i knew that was a lie cuz he only has school monwed but hed let me know he replied to my text to hang out 4 days after i sent it and he was active on social media during that time i replied saying if youre not interested anymore thats totally fine and to let me know rather than leave me hanging i also wished him well with school i didnt want to end in a negative way cuz i hate that anyways he never replied to that text so i was like okay on to the next then he did keep watching my snapchat stories though a month later he contacted me by sending me a shirtless mirror selfie i couldnt help but laugh and was caught off guard i was seeing someone else at the time casually but immaturely and rudely wanted to keep him on the hook like he basically kept me on the hook hes very attractive and i can tell hed be a good lay for a good 10ish days we were back to snapping every day but i was a lot colder i kept saying i was busy and that id let him know when im free and then he said okay let me know i said will do and he stopped contacting again he also stopped watching my snap stories which was unusual behaviour from him 34 months later i created an instagram somehow he was one on the first 30 people to follow me i guess i came up in is suggested contacts or something he likes almost all my pictures and watches my instagram stories i know hes seeing women and doing this with them too since its clearly evident wtf is up with this dude i posted a picture to my instagram story of a baked item i made and he replied to my story with the fire emoticon i said wow long time thank u and he replied i know been busy i said same and he never replied then a couple days later i posted a lot of pictures and videos on my story from a drunk girls night out the last picture was my best friend and i asking if anyone wants to go on a road trip with us let us know we cute and we dont bite too much serious inquires only he replied and said lets do it we talked for a little bit and he suggested a place to go but the conversation quickly fizzled lastly he asked a while back when he can see me again and called me babe i said not right now cuz im in a sticky situation but soon im down for a fuck tbh he said no worries and he hopes everything is ok then said let me know when you want to go on an adventure with me i said what kind of adventure and he said outdoors beach cottage camping etc he is talking a lot more dry then he usually does and takes at least 10 hours to respond to a text but this is an interesting fuck budhe said his friend has a cottage if im down to go anyways that convo fizzled out too he posted a cute picture of his dog to his story to which i replied omg hes adorable he said feel free to come visit he doesnt bite and i said will do when i have time we have to go on that adventure later in july btw he never replied to that a day later he asked me if i wanted to go to the beach that weekend with him i said i was working till late but im going to my friends cottage later that weekend and will see if he can come too if its a huge party he was down but my friend declined extra people so i told him he wasnt allowed and i was sorry also to tease a bit but i was full on serious as well i was like aaahhh damn i was hoping this could work out cuz one of my friends and i are both bi and we all would have had a lit time another time for sure he said no worries have fun we will have fun in the sun when you come back you can bring your friend too if you want to which i said shes more gay than straight but ill see if shes down lmao sorry for assuming things im assuming you contacted me again for something casual if not thats totally fine too just trying to figure out where your mind is at now this is what i dont understand his reply to that help me figure it out please its cool not sure what im looking for kinda want to see what happens have a great weekend cutie whatever that is suppose to mean anyways later on hed casually respond to some of my snapchat stories with saying sexy and even asked whose house is that when i was at a friends 78 million dollar lake house about a week later i asked so are we ever going on that adventure or to which he responded sorry been busy im going to _______ the last weekend of august if youre interested i said sure im down if work permits it i dont want to intrude on your plans ill probably bring a friend or two how many of you are going but i really want to do something next weekend work is consuming my life he said lol thats fine not sure my friend is planning it if your free lets hit a trail or grab a drink im free join the club all i do is work then i was like im down free sometime next week for drinks what does your work schedule look like he didnt open the message for two days its on instagram but hes been active and then he opened it but never replied a week after he ghosted he wasnt watching my stories either then the weekend we were suppose to chill he started watching everything religiously again from that point on about a month later he replied to my story asking me where i worked saying damn to attractive selfies but not progressing more for a couple months he also realized i was having a party and asked when it was i told him the date but he did nothing else to further inquire i posted many stories suggesting im seeing others and he has watched all of those now a month after my party and him religiously watching all my stories he saw a video of me rock climbing he challenged me to rock climb with him at my schools gym he said when youre ready ill take you on and i said maybe sometime soon dont think youll be ready though he said woah challenge accepted a couple weeks later i posted a pretty modest nude to my instagram story and he said damn i wanna see more of you in the new year i said lmaaoo weve been flaking on each other for over a year i think haha but yeah lets set dates im game happy new years eve x then he responded i know just waiting for the right time i guess happy new year cutie keep up the in 2019 i just said right you too babe and thats the end of that why is he still interested what does he think i think of him lol is he even interested tldr sorry for the wall of text but its hard to summarize that so if you have time and are bored please read what the does this guy mean has this happened to you and men that do similar things why do you behave this way no judgement just curious,0

6 surefire tips to improve your relationship with your boyfriend whether you are dating engaged or have been married for years losing the spark in your relationship is almost unavoidable it is no wonder that nowadays more and more couples are seeking counselling in order to keep the spark alive even as you seek counsel on ways to improve your relationship it is important to understand that your actions thoughts and words definitely play a big role in creating a romance that works in this post we will be divulging 6 tips to improve relationship with your boyfriendurl 1 listen to each other but remember to hear not just the words but the meaning too the best thing you can do to ensure a strong relationship with your boyfriend is to listen when he is talking sometimes you will notice he slips in hints about things hed like to do or some place hed like to go or something he really wants you can save this information for later and surprise him you could plan a date to a nice italian restaurant with outdoor tables and a nice view or perhaps he mentions really being interested in something you could get him a book or something related to that topic 2 be thoughtful of your partners unique traits you will agree with me that it is very hard to find a partner who is 100 perfect what this means is that your relationship is likely to be affected by conflict and other annoying habits if this describes your relationship it is important that you look for any positive traits that you like in your partner for instance if you have a partner who is always patient it would be helpful to take that quality into consideration by showing a little appreciation for their patience showing your partner that you appreciate their unique qualities is a great way to make them feel special 3 propose to create a ritual for your relationship after having been in a marriage for 10 or over 20 years it is very hard to still have the same high level of enthusiasm that you had when your relationship started lack of enthusiasm can be quite scary but as a couple you can propose to create time for practices that will bring that passion back for instance you can aim to strengthen your bond by regularly having breakfast in bed together having saturdays as your regular date nights checking in with each other every other day the list is endless 4 have a phonefree hour every day with the social media craze is going on you will agree with me that phones are a big let down to relationships if you are really looking to improve your relationship then you must learn to tame your habits in as far as your phone is concerned as a couple it is advisable to keep your phone away for at least one hour or two every day and use that time to maximize your affection 5 try new things together if your old habits are kind of boring try out new activities together incorporating new enjoyable activities in your todo lists is not only exhilarating but it also tends to help you as a couple develop a new attachment to each other and helps to further glue your relationship playing online game together in the privacy of your own home could be one such new activity all you need is to give him a promotional betting bonus code which you had collected earlier to avail bonus money while registering at the site this new activity is a surefire tip to bring him closer to you than ever before 6 show respect for each other for romance to thrive both partners need to highly respect each other couples should make it intentional to respect their significant other because failing to do so only puts their relationship down to a lower level it is important that each partner makes it his or her responsibility to fix issues and respond to partners desires and needs without being disrespectful respect in a relationship should be equal from both sides or it will likely cause conflict at some point here are nine signs of an equal relationship source newsziicomurl,0

me 26 m with my housemate and friend 23 f of 3 months she made some jokes at my expense that hurt my feelings when i told her she got incredibly angry at me and started arguing about other things in the house unrelated to this issue and went to her room has not spoken to me in three days hello rrelationships so this one might seem a little silly but ive been ruminating on it for the past few days and i could use some objective outsider advice on how best to manage it background my housemate lets call her laura moved in to my house in early january we instantly hit it off and started spending a lot of time together after work we would lie in each others beds and cuddle watch fashion runway shows and critique all the models drink wine and talk about our exs our past traumas and our hopes and dreams watch trashy reality tv and generally support each other she is a little younger than me but we are at similar stages in life both of us are working close to our home and its been really nice to have her around just great fun with injokes a plenty and i even told her about my anxiety disorder and the antidepressants i take and she told me about her assault our third housemate brendan 30 m moved over from romania to work in the same field as me here he was moving to ireland for his wife who has now left him so he is understandably in a bad mood but he is a very difficult person to be around i have tried to be supportive and help him out but i go to work every day and put up with the shitty health care system and then come home and have to listen to him complain about it all over again me and laura bonded a lot over our shared burden of carrying poor brendan wed take shifts and everything he also never once ever cleaned the kitchen left his takeaway boxes on the table smoked all my cigarettes ate my food and never took the bins out i like my house to be clean i hate clutter i dont like bad smells its a really nice house and since ive been living here longer than the other two i feel its my responsibility to keep the place well i also manage all the bills i manage the rent and i park on the street risking a ticket and fine so the others can use the driveway the issue me and laura have a very jokey relationship in the way we talk to one another for example when we moved in she put a big sticker saying fat on my weighing scales and so i threw her eyeliner out the window were a bit like a brother and sister sort of always mocking each other playfully making small little jokes at each others expense well usually her making jokes at my expense but this has worked quite well and i have enjoyed it and laughed a lot but last thursday laura had had a bad day at work over something and was in a bad mood at home i was giving her cuddles and asking her about it and she was telling me and that was all fine and then we went about our plans of going to the shop to get treats and home to watch americas next top model she was making jokes at my expense as usual but they were harsher and more frequent than normal when i bought my bar of chocolate she counted out the calories on the back saying i needed to seriously use portion control or how would i ever find a man then in the car on the way back she said that if i had sex with someone i would be conscious of all of my bits jiggling during sex im 173m tall and weigh in at 70kg so i am not overweight but i am trying to lose some weight and i go to the gym a lot for conditioning and cardio for the anxiety of course im not really fat but there are different standards for gay men and i want to be attractive to other guys so i do want to lose some weight and laura knows this the last comment that really hurt me was when later watching the models someone said if you could get plastic surgery on one thing on your body what would you get and i thought about it and said i dont think theres anything i would want to change then laura chimed in saying i can think of 7 things off the top of my head that you need to get plastic surgery on and started laughing i know it was meant as a joke and not serious but that one hurt my feelings i finished out the episode and went to bed i felt like a doormat or a punching bag all day the next day i kept ruminating over how i was the only one in the house who cleaned the place how i as the only person doing basic communal things like bins and stocking fridge and for laura to say that to me showed me that like fuck my feelings like i can just be your punching bag to get out your stressful day at work i have never once nor will i ever comment on her body like that does she think its ok to say that to me because i am a man the communication all of these thoughts were bubbling away so i decided to talk to her about it the following day and it didnt go as planned i said to her hey i know me and you joke around a lot and i usually really enjoy it but yesterday you went too far with the plastic surgery comment and it hurt my feelings and she basically got extremely defensive straight away and started arguing with me saying how am i meant to know what will offend you and what wont how is it fair that one day youll be fine but the next i have to watch what i say incase i offend you it was clearly meant as a joke and i said i know it was a joke and you didnt mean it i just wanted to get it off my chest that it was a hurtful joke and its not ok for you to take out your work frustrations on me im not your gay pet then she changed the subject entirely and without warning and was actually shouting at me at this point saying and i know you went into my room and took the cups out and washed them you do not have permission to go in there i had taken cups out of her room to use the dishwasher because if i didnt then no one was ever gonna but i also can recognise and respect that there was a boundary there that i didnt think was a boundary and i had crossed it by entering her room alone so i apologised immediately for that and said that i hadnt known she stormed off to her bedroom and didnt look or talk to me for the rest of the night the silent treatment now to make matters even more complicated that very evening i happened to have a gentleman caller over to the house and me and lauras bedrooms are adjacent and share a wall which we affectionately named the berlin wall and we would always be talking to each other through it as it is quite thin i had sex with my man friend on my bed at around 11pm she had work in the morning i did not and the bed was extremely creaky and i was really conscious of how loud we were being i eventually actually cut the sex short because of the noise knowing she had work next day i text her saying sorry about noise but got no response we havent spoken since she came home from work friday and went straight to her room to pack for going home to her family home up the country for the weekend i called up the stairs asking did she want anything from the shop but she just said no im leaving for home now its been radio silence ever since im driving myself mad thinking what i have done wrong and how i could have approached the situation better i want to show that i am assertive and wont have those comments made about me but i dont want to push laura away because i love spending time with her right now im just giving her space im thinking hoping that when i confronted her she felt guilty and thats why she reacted like that as guilt is an unpleasant emotion so she went on the attack without thinking im hoping that after the cooldown period at home she will talk to me again and things can go back to normal she will be home tonight but i am on call working till 8pm i feel really nervous to see her like i dont know where on earth this is headed and its stressing me out loads do you guys have any advice on how to navigate this successfully i would really appreciate your insight or to tell me where ive gone wrong or if i should reach out and apologise again or just leave it and let her come to me in her own time tldr housemate told me i needed to get plastic surgery in 7 different places to look pretty as a joke when i confronted her about it she got angry at me and then i had loud sex up against the berlin wall hasnt spoken to me in three days,0

hey im looking for some dating advice im an 18 year old guy interested in girls tldr i like a girl but recently got out of a relationship a few months ago and dont if im ready for a new relationship or if it would be fair on the new girl so thats a quick summary so to start my story i have to go back 1 year i started noticing this girl around quite regularly i thought she was very pretty but never felt like i had a good reason to talk to her that was until i realised she was a swimmer this was perfect i was a swimmer for the national under 18s men team but i was still a bit hesitant so 1 month past and my friend and i were getting some food and my friend new i liked this girl she walks into the line to get some food and my friend urges me to talk to her so i do i introduce myself and we had a good chat i even made her laugh a few times i didnt tell her about the swimming yet because i thought she might think i was up my own arse sorry that night she added me on snapchat and sent me a message and we continued talking until she fell asleep i went to bed that night so happy because i hadnt felt that way in a long time so a week passed and no messages but all hope wasnt lost because she kept smiling at me and when we talked it wasnt awkward and we always had good conversation so fast forward another month we are talking everyday and every night and i couldnt be happier however now it got kinda awkward because i found out my friend was also messaging her in the same way i was so we spoke about and decided that eventually she will decide who she likes more and she did it was me so she stopped speaking to my friend without me knowing so the day comes we both feel super comfortable around each other and she keeps talking about us as an item so i ask her out and she says yes as you can imagine i was over the moon to celebrate i took her to a nice dinner i paid for the whole thing and we both has a great time we went swimming together and both got really competitive and of course i had to let her win a few times in my eyes she was the perfect girl loved sport not to focused on how she looked but enjoyed makeup and clothes but not obsessive always liked to improve herself and was extremely motivated i loved that she match me perfectly and made me want to push myself even more she was such a strong women and i respected the hell out of her a few months into our relationship and a problem started to arise she got very ill this part will be quite graphic skip forward to the next paragraph if you dont like that kinda stuff she kept being sick and lots of the time it contained blood her periods were heavy and sometimes she even got 2 a month sometimes she just fainted for no reason and it panicked me so much she kept insisting that the only thing she didnt like was the double period i encouraged her to go the doctor and she did they had to run tests on her for months to try and find what was wrong she kept getting new medications to try and treat whatever it was but doctors couldnt pin it down with all the medications she suffered with lack of sleep irritability mood swings loss of appetite headaches and even more vomiting i was get more and more worried i suggested a cancer screening and she agreed she went and got a negative result and we were both relieved but she still couldnt eat much at all she lost weight and looked pale then a revelation happened the doctors found out she had celiac disease for those who dont know that means you cant digest gluten so she goes gluten free and finally her health recovers and we were both so happy 3 months later after everything was all good it was my birthday now unfortunately we couldnt be together for a few weeks either side of my birthday or on my birthday due to exam season and she get extremely upset about this i understood this as i would have been upset about it if the boot was on the other foot i assumed she had something planned and was upset because it hasnt worked out but i ended up nailing my exams and exam season was over and finally i get to spend all summer with my best friend so we go to the beach on our first day of summer and then go back to our friends house for a few drinks and some food and it was a great day later that month she starts to act distant from me and within 2 days she suddenly hated my guts i had no idea what had happened i was panicking she was screaming and shouting and crying she didnt see me for weeks after that she didnt message me but i messaged her because i wanted to know she was okay at this point i knew she was seriously upset about something 2 days after messaging her and no response she blocked me on every form of communication i only messaged her on snapchat and called her phone a few times i havent seen her since this happened i got terribly depressed and didnt eat for 14 days i lost my place on the swimming team and still to this day have not fully recovered i went a bit insane my friends stood by me and one of my friends helped especially we went out to clubs for every single one of those 14 days bringing fuelled by substances i wont disclose here and ending up in places that were dangerous spending a ridiculous amount of money having sex with girls we didnt know and havent seen since and we dont know anything about them but we assume we arent dads since we havent got a phone call or letter in the mail i ended up in hospital underweight dehydrated and depressed and suicidal i had betrayed everything i ever stood for and for what now im at university and im having a great time i love my course and studies ive made so many friends and live in a house with 3 other people and am going to live in a house with 11 people next school year and obviously there are girls at uni and im interested in a girl my friends live with and im living with her next year but i dont think i should go for it because i still miss my last girlfriend quite a bit and i still think about her sometimes that wouldnt be fair on her and she may not even be into it anyway thank you for listening to my story and my vent if you made it this far you are a gem of a human being i know that because im studying geology as well so i know gems anything you have to say is very welcome,0
i 26f cant stand that my boyfriend 29m is so unemotional and its draining me but i feel powerless to leave tldr my boyfriend isnt very expressive creative or selfreflective and it bothers me because after experiencing chronic dissociation as a teenager ive put a lot of effort into being more in touch with my emotions and being a more creative and expressive person im afraid im being pretentious a hypocrite and simultaneously that im trapping us both by repeating a harmful submissive behavioral pattern that i learned from previous toxic relationships where i dont communicate that im upset or the gravity of how upset i am just to keep the peace we also work together and that complicates things i know intellectually that my decisions about the relationship are nobodys business but me and his the real reason im making this post is that emotionally i need permission from society to break up with him or stay with him thats why this is a wall of text thats the real problem i was emotionally detached in high school and college because i was so socially anxious to the point that i couldnt function im still an introvert and not perfect or even great at expressing myself but im leagues ahead of where i was now i like socializing and getting to know people because it challenges me and keeps my brain active i dont ever want to go back to when i would mentally and emotionally shut down around everyone and only existed as an empty shell of a person with no original thoughts or ideas of their own ive spent a lot of effort getting better at being more observant asking myself how do i actually feel about this why do i feel this way how can i articulate that its been very effective at stopping me from completely retreating into my own head i have a lot of creative hobbies that help me get my feelings out however im still spineless and cant confront people or upset them if i feel hurt by someone i find ways to justify their behavior while criticizing my own or ill suppress negative thoughts and feelings entirely just so i can get through interacting with them it became an automatic defense mechanism from an emotionallypsychologically abusive friendship that included very frequent gaslighting constant harsh criticisms rewriting situations of me asserting myself as me being rude encouraged by my mother and the insistence that every time i was acting inappropriately everyone would notice and everyone would judge me for it the second toxic friendship was someone who was possibly a literal narcissist she was charming and entertaining enough to get away with manipulating and humiliating people especially those that she felt had wronged her i coped with them both by dissociating what i call going on autopilot in both cases i felt trapped because they insisted on interacting with me and i couldnt possibly argue back or defend myself with my fractured mental state i stayed quiet instead of fighting a battle i couldnt win i kept up a relationship with them long after i should have cut them off they both eventually stopped contacting me on their own so i never actually learned to assert myself my boyfriend is nothing like these people even though he doesnt abuse me im worried that im trapping us both in another relationship where i have a valid reason to want to leave but i shame myself into staying because of the fear of everyone judging me weve been dating for nearly 4 years and are each others first serious relationship we work for the same employer its not even a secret everyone at work noticed and now its common knowledge in the company that were dating hes a smart person great at his job and a very sweet and doting boyfriend all i have to do is say that im cold and he will snuggle me or hand me his jacket ill mention something that i like offhandedly and hell suggest doing it or bring it to me within the week hes my work gossip buddy and workout buddy we can speak about things at work and about our field in a way that we cant with our friends hes the first person i text when im feeling strong emotions and i just need to tell someone he says he has social anxiety and also dissociates sometimes in large groups or new social situations he has the same problem that i have because of his anxiety he has trouble being observant and expressing himself when we first started dating i noticed that i felt differently about him outside of work if i didnt see him at work i would ask him about his day and he would only say it was fine nothing interesting happened how about you sometimes he would give a list of things he did like he cleaned his house he played video games he watched netflix he read an article about todays political scandal and hell briefly describe how crazy that was in monotone but he wouldnt have any stories to tell me about himself or how he felt about anything he personally observed and that would end that conversation if i asked more questions he would give maybe a sentence or two in response that wasnt conducive to further conversation i told him about myself including what i want to do with my life and those terrible friends i had i excitedly talked about what i thought about what we were doing at work and groaned about our bosses he listened intently was never judgmental gave constructive criticism laughed at all my jokes and supported me unconditionally i didnt notice at the time that although he had interests he didnt really have much to say about them he liked cooking still does and talked about cooking but he wasnt really excited about cooking he talked about his past and his family when directly asked but he never expressed or talked about how anything affected him he never said anything that i could validate for him he didnt tell me his feelings or insecurities he had so that i could support him i did almost all the talking i was compulsively talking about anything to fill the silence most of our dates were him cooking for usgoing out to dinner then going back to his place he hated my shitty apartment and watching something then sleeping together he wouldnt let me do anything for him in bed and he was dead silent for two years even when i asked him to make noise because it made him uncomfortable and he said he only wanted to please me he expressed about the emotional range of a small magnet he was usually either pleasantly content or sulking he tended to only text me first to discuss plans or ask what i was up to conversations were centered around me or shared common interests but never about him if we wanted things that conflicted with each other he would almost always defer to me i thought all this was really romantic at the time until i noticed hed never let me do him any favors hes often sick and every time i offered to bring him something he said no thank you i had to throw a tantrum once when i wanted to do the dishes for him after he cooked dinner for us both what i knew drove me completely fucking bonkers about the relationship at the time was that he became whiny and excessively complained when he was minorly physically uncomfortable like if he was a little bit sweaty hungry tired etc with no way to fix it he would go into a corner and sulk even if we were out with friends if he couldnt go into a corner he would cling to me and sulk he very often resorted to default responses like canned stock phrases that cost him no mental effort and dont encourage further dialogue like yeah that sounds fun glad you had a good timethat sucks that happened hope it gets better im sorry hope it gets easierat least this happened or didnt happenshould be a good timewhen were about to eat lets chow downgreat cant wait he used to be really bad about this especially in situations where what i wanted was empathy he also dropped these cheesy cringeinducing romantic lines it used to be that if we werent at work he would only start talking to tell me something romantic or to initiate cuddling or sex he would say something like i love cuddling with you so much his favorite thing to do was to grab my ass or boobs then say sorry i couldnt resistsorry i couldnt help myself he called me baby once and i told him that i liked it because at the time it was something different i regret ever saying that because now its become one of his default words whats up baby how you doing baby you ready for bed baby other than enjoying cooking and being great at it he doesnt have any creative hobbies outside of work he does regular chores at his apartment smokes weed grows weed watches tv shows browses reddit and plays video games he is constantly consistently on reddit but he only lurks and never comments which is objectively not bad but it bothers me to an irrational level i tried to foster an emotional connection with him by watching things together playing our favorite games or listening to music together and i would continuously get frustrated when afterwards he only offered simple opinions delivered flatly like it was neat it was a solid album the fight choreography was cool he then told me that he really doesnt feel anything from movies games or tv shows he passively consumed what i consider to be beautifully written thoughtprovoking and inspiring media like its mindless entertainment and even though i know thats objectively not bad it baffles me when i was dissociated stories and music were the only ways left i could feel anything writing about them on message boards was the only way i could really talk to anyone at the same time whenever i was pissed off at him i held back how pissed off i actually was because of my autopilot defense mechanism when we were at home he had to be constantly touching me groping me grabbing my ass or boobs or cuddling that was actually squeezing to the point where i felt like i had no personal space we would be watching a movie and he would be holding a boob not squeezing it not paying any attention to it otherwise just holding it my friends called it the im excited to have a girlfriend grope i would politely ask him to stop groping or squeezing me he would stop pout and say awwww sometime later he would mindlessly do it again i told him to stop then he would joke about it sorry i couldnt resist and we repeated the process i didnt scream at him that i asked him to fucking stop like five times already he is also mostly responsible for the only panic attack i ever had i trusted him to give me an amount of edible that i a nonweed user should be able to handle he didnt think about that and he gave me the same amount he gives himself a very heavy weed user then after i calmed down a bit from the attack but was still very very high he tried to initiate sex i said no and he listened but i was fucking fuming that he thought that was a good time i noticed that i was feeling numb and would go into autopilot at times on dates and i knew that only happened when i was suppressing negative emotions i had so many emotions and ideas that i wanted to express to him and i wanted to do things for him too he never talked about his past so there seems to be nothing from it that meant anything to him when i asked him to tell me a story from his past he put up a lot of resistance and said his childhood was boring he would talk about work things on reddit food that he was making video games and politics only when prompted it seemed like the only fulfillment he got in life was pampering me and getting to touch me because that was almost everything he really wanted to say my idea of minimum acceptable verbalemotional communication may be off nearly all of my friends and family are talkative people when i talk with my friends we play off each other and can go on for hours all of my friends love stories and music as much as i do and think about them as much as i do all of my friends have rich interior lives and some kind of creative outlet or a bunch of random hobbies that they make sound interesting i learn new things about them whenever i talk to them they are for the most part emotionally aware of themselves they are skilled enough at observing and commenting on every day occurrences that they make normal life interesting and fun i can feel how passionate they are when they speak i barely sense any emotion from him my friends think that hes a little bit robotic and delicate but hes still a great guy theyre not wrong one friend in particular keeps saying that hes great for me and not wanting to talk about feelings is just how guys are but it seems like all my other male friends some of whom are married are able to do this you cant get everything that you want in a relationship the most important thing is that he cares about you i thought he was slow to open up and not everyone had to be like my friends i could gently encourage him and eventually he would open up and tell me more about himself hey do you think you could stop using your stock phrases like it was neat and great cant wait and try to put more creative thought into your texts also stop the romantic lines i want to hear what you really think and the lines sound insincere please stop literally squeezing me and holding my boobs whenever we watch things its weird and your hands are sweaty maybe you could try actually saying something on reddit instead of just lurking could you come up with opinions about the things we watch and describe your day instead of saying nothing happened something happened to you today i dont care how stupid or inconsequential you think it is i want to hear what you thought about it im going to start doing more things for you and i want you to let me because i dont like being unequal i thought i was trying to improve communication and that these were small adjustments to make i really didnt think i was trying to change him as a person i was tired of feeling like a spoiled princess my personal space being constantly taken advantage of and my range of emotions being squashed by his own limited one i hoped he only needed time and eventually he would let me into his inner world and actually be the secretly deep and introspective person i thought he was these talks eventually became im not happy because i dont communicate in the moment when im upset with you and you dont want to communicate at all he said that he agreed and he wanted to get better at expressing himself while i would try not to hold things back until i exploded when i first brought up the excessive whining and pampering he responded with annoyance defensiveness and a lack of selfawareness when i first brought up the whining after years of tolerating it even though i didnt get angry he yelled at me that he just wasnt that strong a person and it ended with him storming out and slamming the door he still refused to believe for awhile that he was that bad when i tried to bring the problem up in the moment he demonstrated it he overreacted i didnt even yell i said simply in response to his complaint you could be a little less whiny about it that was all it took he got flustered then stormed off i could tell he was angry because when people walk very quickly ahead of you that you have to run to keep up and their feet are slamming the ground and theyre not responding to your requests to slow down that means theyre angry doesnt it but when i asked if he was mad at me he sighed and said no then he insisted that his complaining wasnt a big deal and he was going to ask my friends if they thought he complained too much i dared him to do it because they have seen his captiousness for themselves and i have an entire reddit post to show him as the last straw he never did ask when i told him that i dont want to be pampered he got defensive then he said if you want to do something you should just ask as if he forgot every previous time i asked and he said no thank you or insisted that he do it he gets prissy whenever hes stressed out for example the other day he needed to put his cat into a travel cage to go in the car which of course the cat hates and resists every time i pissed it off immediately prior to this by picking it up over and over and finally sticking it behind a closed door because it wouldnt stop eating the christmas tree my boyfriend groaned and said well great thanks for making it harder for me and no i didnt argue back that maybe i shouldve let the stupid cat eat the tree we have made things better he stopped groping and squeezing and i feel like i have enough personal space now i do the dishes when hes done cooking instead of excessively complaining when hes physically uncomfortable he recognizes that hes about to get into this mood and sees himself out hes dropped a lot of the stock phrases and most of the cheesy lines he puts more effort into starting a conversation with me and talking to my friends hes still great to work with and talk to about a variety of topics he can have a lot of eloquent responses when talking about something like our field hes great at polite small talk and schmoozing at company events he can give me a great pep talk or advice when im upset but still getting him to talk honestly about himself or get an emotional response from him is like running into a brick wall it still feels like when i ask him a personal question he doesnt really have an answer so he says what he thinks sounds romantic or what i want to hear if we are cuddling and i ask him what hes thinking the answer will be that hes horny recently when we went to see a concert afterwards he asked me if i had fun and i said i had a great time i was shocked that they played my favorite song because i thought it was too obscure compared to their other popular songs i asked if he had a good time and he said of course the best part was being there with you when i asked him recently what his dreams are he said its to get a masters degree he doesnt know in what and for us to live together then when i asked him what are you looking for in the person you want to spend the rest of your life with he just described me after i questioned that further he admitted he hadnt really ever thought about it before i asked i have had to push him every step of the way to be more open and examine his own feelings i have to hold his hand through basic introspection skills i dont like that it feels like my job to evaluate the relationship and point out problems and i dont like feeling that every time i do it he gets stressed that his comfort bubble is popped i feel like im holding myself back all the time because im disappointed every time i ask him what hes thinking and he gives a generalized or trite answer or doesnt carry on a conversation hes improved so much and hes trying but its not enough i can write pages and pages of text and he can barely write enough for twitter i dont like the dynamic we have outside of work there he cant pamper me or touch me he cant turn his brain off if i ask him what hes thinking he has to give me a real answer instead of responding with something cheesy or sexual we are complete equals and are each others perfect audience to bounce ideas off of at work i admire him and want him at home im frustrated and confused it feels like to me if i didnt put in all this effort even if he doesnt use obvious cheesy lines our relationship outside of work would be quiet romantic cuddlysexy time with no depth or introspection i dont expect my partner to write the next great american novel but is it too much to want him to have realistic thoughts about himself and our relationship to have a larger emotional range am i being pretentious am i wrong to want a boyfriend that expresses himself challenges himself to leave his comfort bubble has a creative outlet wont get flustered when i ask them too personal a question that has actually taken the time to examine himself and what he wants and can articulate it and will check in with the relationship regularly i wanted a boyfriend i could share emotions with i didnt expect to have to drag them out hes not a bad person at all which is why i feel so guilty i understand why he is the way he is being anxious in response to stress the obliviousness the lack of creativity and emotional range saying things you think people want to hear because you dont actually have an answer i used to do all of that am i a hypocrite or selfish if im upset about him having the same problems i used to have if it does come to me leaving i dont know how to do it i still love him im afraid i will regret it the second i do it what if we could have fixed it are either of us too broken to be in a relationship intentionally making someone upset goes against my programming so hard it feels unnatural breaking his heart feels like kicking a puppy if i break us up it will make everyone upset including our coworkers absolutely all of them will notice and everyone will judge me i will go back on autopilot convince us both that im making a big deal about nothing and then scream at myself later i didnt know i was this bad i didnt think i would do this i fucked up and i dont know if i can fix it,0

its not you its me my ex 10 years my ex use to yell at me if i didnt know what i wanted to order as soon as we got in the drive thru my boyfriend tells the drive thru cashier to will be a few minutes and tells me to take my time there rush my ex would get drunk and yell at me for 4 hours telling me how horrible i was that i was i psycho that no wonder he dies what he does my boyfriend tells me how beautiful i am for 4 hours when i feel defeated by a world that has no use for my kind heart my ex would have me doubt my own thoughts my own sixth sense people that i should of listen too for years telling me it was in my head constantly hide his phonebe on his phone for hours in the middle of the night where he always had access to my phone my boyfriend never gives me any thoughts other than how a real relationship should be how honest he is how theres no secrets regarding phones my ex and i werent friends on social media every photo was to be vetted prior i wasnt aloud to post pictures esp of us together only ones he approved or i would be seen as desperate and attention seeking or i didnt look hot enough my boyfriend has us as his picture he posts of our adventures and things that we both do always quoting how happy and how lovely i am he tags me in dog memes and sends shit he know i would love no hiding my ex would tell me that i wasnt good enough at my job and no one likes me just so i lost my confidence to do things my boyfriend help and guides me through things if needed and he will walk to work with me when i get home he will ask how my day was and listen to me rant or be frustrated and then kiss my head and cuddle me up my ex never helped me bring the shopping in i was terrified to tell him how much i spent on what he needed or what he requested losing his shit and making me go back out if i had accidentally forgotten something my boyfriend runs to open the door for me and wont let me carry anything even my purse and if i forget something he will go and get it or say it doesnt matter my ex when i was sick and stuck in hospital with nothing but my clothes i had on away from family and little friends i had left me there didnt call or check or drive the two hours to bring me anything instead just fell out with me for a week because i hadnt txt him for a hour hour as my phone never had battery as soon as i say i have a headache or feel ill my boyfriend gets me water tells me to rest will ask how i feel and even when im hungover sick he will bring me breakfast in bed and leave me sleep haha my ex would start a argument or a fight amoung my friends and i have me make up excuses and lies so i couldnt go out with my friends i lost a lot of friends because of this my boyfriend comes out with me and my friends and wants to know them my ex told me that my family bullied me that they took me for advantage and were trying to get in my head he met them once in 10 years i would have to avoid family gatherings etc my boyfriend said he loved my family took time to spend time with everyone of them he wanted to meet my entire family never complaining once my ex said that he scraped the bottom of the barrel when he found me why would anyone want me he would comment on my face my hair my clothes my figure tell me to train more tell me i was to dye my hair blonder my boyfriend tells me he loves me the way i am and gets frustrated when i have no confidence tells me im his gorgeous girlfriend my ex threw a breakfast sandwich at me that i made him at 5am before work because it didnt have cheese on it my boyfriend is appreciative that i get up at 5am to make him breakfast or anything that i do for him tells me how good i am too him my exs birthday and christmass he would give me a list of things he wanted he would expect everything on the list and if he didnt he would sulk and say that i obviously dont care for him or complain that he didnt get want he wanted and fall out with me for days this was a regular thing when in return in 10 years he only ever bought me two christmas presents both i boughtordered for myself and only ever received one birthday card coz he wasnt about the fuss my boyfriend tells me how im so generous and loves everything i have ever got him never complaining once even when its something shit our first christmas he bought me gifts of things that i had mentioned during our relationship never have i ever been spoilt so much by any human not that im materialistic but the thought is there i would understand if there was a financial issue but i have been in debt in the past because of this person turns out in 10 years he has a girl friend of 4 years and a wife and two children he would lie and tell me that he was with his kids when he was on holiday with the other girl he told her the same when he was with and he told his wife that he was away with work there was a number of girls over the years that seemed to appear after i finally ended it making me feel small pathetic and worthless never has someone made me feel so humiliated in my life to a point i would question whether my life was with living if i really was that horrible person and no one would ever want me that i was never gonna be good enough for anyone thenhe appeared like some kinda tall tanned adonis my boyfriend made me realise what is right how a relationship should be basically saved me but he doesnt know this my ex is an unattractive self centred lyingcontrolling cheating selfish narcissist my boyfriend is a caring loving and attentive soul trustworthy and honestwho would do anything for me and is literally the hottest guy ive ever seen as cheesey as it sounds i didnt think these people still existed and i am constantly scared that its a dream and it will all go wrong hence why its 0346am and im awake on here never settle for an unhealthy love you are worth it i am proof that you can move on i had to share my own experiences because i know a lot of people can relate,0

normal family and ive tried so hard to make that happen but were broken were going to counseling tomorrow to try to figure out how to end this the best way we can for us i am considering also showing him this thread if its not too painful the backstory which paints why i cant see her as my daughter which is largely due to how he originally made me not trust him as a father or husband we hooked up a year and a half ago i didnt eat and drank too fast because i was speaking publicly by mistake got black out drunk which i never let happen to myself i was ashamed we hooked up he didnt use a condom we are both responsible from that point i was put off by him and didnt really want to see him because in my head that told me a lot about him and myself for that matter we still talked i love talking to him and hes always been incredibly kind and giving so i thought id give it a second shot because hey we all make mistakes a month or two later we see each other again and im really depressed because i hadnt felt true love in a long time i go out dancing a lot and we live on the west coast in a major tech city where a lot of what would be normal people are into psychedelics ive been here a few years so im used to it he ends up doing too much k and hes nervous and embarrassed but im not super phased by it because i kind of just wanted to hook up and i go to his house but again didnt take it seriously because i didnt respect someone with a kid going out and doing drugs irresponsibly with someone he still didnt know all that well i fucking get there and wanted to leave his place was a mess an absolute mess and then i realized his daughter lives there every other week in my mind i was so turned off by this guy i couldnt believe he almost 40 and living like his partying bringing random girls home to this place and also having unprotected sex but the day after something happened to my eye he took all day off to take care of me i felt adored it was such a huge dilemma for me so i figured maybe ive been painting him all wrong he obviously seems like hes fallen for me hard but then i kept asking him to get tested and it took him like 4 months and he used every excuse during that time we broke it off like twice i was appalled he has a kid what kind of father acts like that i told myself a lot my respect for him and as a father tanked the intros to the daughter happened far too soon within two weeks shes been so used to girls coming and going it didnt phase her also he didnt tell me he was still married and going through a messy divorce and potentially being a fulltime dad until 2 months into the relationship after he said he loved me huge slap in my faceshes incredibly sweet and bright he does treat her well is very present with her and adores her but there are things i dont agree with first of all he still lives like an artist meaning sometimes hes still waiting for checks in the mailwe went on vacation together early on and as were in a car he asks me if i can spot him because checks havent cleared i would never have a child under those circumstances and if i did i would choose their future financial well being over my dream even now i have to sacrifice what i want to do for my career for whats feasible for a condition that i have that requires a lot of treatment the girl is also 11 and she doesnt partake in chores in the house i have issues with his hygiene and then realized shes not made to take a shower every day thats fine if its someone elses kid but fuck not my own i used to get so angry because hes wipe cum on his sheets and then id realize like 2 months later were still in the same sheets and his daughter is climbing into bed with us he still barely cleans we agreed that id help him find a maid but she rarely comes and im always telling him i hate staying at his place im repulsed hes tried to get better but fuck the idea of living in this chaos and having to train two people one who is not mine who i dont feel like i love and ive tried to be active in her life so much but i cant say i love her like my own i like her like any other kid and have about as much patience but ill never see myself being as excited as my own child i just cant love her and maybe because i also see her as an extension of all these bad things about him that hes instilled in her that i never had a chance to be a part of to try to guide in our relationship my ptsd was triggered from a rough childhood ive put myself in iop and its helped but i guess the constant anxiety of really needing his love but hating everything about the environment i was in just destroyed i take responsibility in letting it get there and im trying to work throgh my flaws which did not give me the confidence to know ill be ok without him but he did show up after his daughter moved away he was there for me he was also before but you know how it is he has obligations and i understood but i am human and still wished we could have been just us but he learned how i worked helped with anything to set a routine to help me do my ptsd exercises and also take care of my other condition he was very patient at one point we broke up a few months ago and i started seeing someone else a fling and got back together hes also been very accepting and patient with that as well but i also think its a crutch but it really kills me because hes the only person in my life that always wants to be there for me even when it gets bad and were on the rocks i cant tell if thats his seperation issues and mine but thats where hes better than me where he can put things aside and still want to mend so then ive been in a rough cycle i hate the state of what our relationship is and it just never seems like itll work but were also best friends i hate him for some aspects of the way he is but i know he doesnt mean harm hes just lazy and makes a lot of excuses im ok with that in a friend but not a husband he keeps saying he wants to grow with me and have a family with me buut i never see how it would be possible i feel like im wasting my time i feel like he ruined it with how he was in the beginning hes changed a lot but its so marred the holidays are here and he has custody of her then the day she comes back i hadnt seen him in almost a week shes around and yelling and its making me anxious during a time im really trying to destress everythings a mess she says daddy today i was supposd to shower its my shower day and im grossed out because he didnt prioritize that he wasnt going to brush his teeth before bed until i said something again and then shes like daddy can i sleep with you guys and he looks at me i mean im sorry i cant see her as my own im grossed out and now i have this pressure to tell her no he says i could have said no i could have but its putting so much pressure on me where i already feel so prssured and i couldnt take it i excused mysf and said i felt sick and left i keep hoping one day i can get over it and feel like a family i feel like an evil step mother because i cant see myself loving her hes not making it easy i thought maybe if he had a nice home was organized was more responsible with his life and career maybe i could take in someone elses kid even then i dont know but i tried so hard made her such elaborate cakes for her birthday send her texts when shes gone even drove up with them to drop her off at her moms when she moved but i cant reciprocate love like her stepfather has with her but i love the good times i had with her father so much he doesnt want to let it go he always tried coming back to me when we broke it off i found that weird that i could say i dont know if i could love your child and hes still try to be with me but its hard hes gone to therapy although the too late but has improved a lot weve been through a lot of shit and now were toxic best friends its so hard because i dont feel like i can count on anyone like i have with him sure he pisses me off but no one in this world had put in so much effort to try to make this work i guess the trauma for the beginning might not ever let me move on like i said were going to therapy tomorrow to try to make a clean break for everyone i still want my best friend or maybe im clinging and cant move on maybe someone out there can share some insight tell me im being evil for not loving a child or show some compassion or maybe miraculously tell me how i can save this with some magic elixir or how do you make a clean break in therapy tldr i have been trying to break it off with my boyfriend because i resent his irresponsible behavior i endured for months which has made it impossible to see myself being a stepmom to his daughter and him a good husband but hes my best friend thanks guys happy holidays,0

i 31f dont know if i should loan money to my irresponsible 22f friend backstory first were coworkers im actually one of her bosses but pretty close friends as well we hang out we go out to breakfast send each other goofy messages shes watched my kids we share juicy gossip and she gropes my ass and boobs from time to time i could do without the last part but i dont want to hurt her feelings and tell her im not attracted to her in that way anywho a couple months ago she and another coworker tried to get me fired she claims she was cornered into making a statement against me so she did im not going to reveal details because this isnt a throwaway and i still have nightmares over it i could have lost my job my livelihood the source of income for me and my rather large family i was devastated and felt so betrayed i got written up to the worst severity but my job is still intact at this point in time and guess what i forgave her and the other coworker i really dontcant hold grudges it isnt in my blood to be that kind of toxic person but obviously now im apprehensive of our friendship and kinda distrustful fast forward to this week a mere four weeks after the investigation at work was closed my friend has the audacity to ask for help with a speeding ticket fine somewhere in the ballpark of 150 she dropped major hints and then finally outright asked me last night coming from the woman who pays for her drinks at the bar her lunches at work sometimes her nails and makeup she knows this is petty cash to me but should i be giving petty cash to a petty person ohhh and i gave her 100 just because i could tell she was struggling like 2 months ago i mean i love her and feel bad for her but this feels wrong plus she was fucking speeding like over 30 mph over the speed limit soooooo idk what should i do tldr my friend tried or at least aided in almost getting me fired now she wants money for a speeding ticket and i dont know how to say no,0

i 22f dont get along with his 23m friends tldr the title of this post how do i deal can i long backstory ahead my boyfriend oliver and i have been seeing each other for a little under a year at this point we met in college and we have so much fun together basically living together 3 days at my place 3 at his every week traveling eating out and just generally enjoying each others company standard relationship fare we have one major problem which is his friends i dont get along with some of them one of them recently just stirred up drama yesterday well call her penelope oliver is friends with penelope because they went to high school together i dont think they actually have a lot in common they hang out very infrequently twice last year despite not living very far from each other and when ive asked him why theyre friends all he said was shes nice and was a cool girl in high school it doesnt help that they hooked up early on in college as this makes me definitely feel a little territorial around her even though shes engaged the first time and so far only time in person i met her this past december i admit that i came in on a high horse she didnt ask me anything about me so i got a little butthurt and asked her why she was getting married so young im blunt and very to the point but again i admit that this had a judgmental jab in it later before new years i tried to extend an olive branch i had oliver text her letting her know that if she needed ceremony music id be happy to help ive been playing classical violin my whole life and have done wedding gigs since i was 10 she texted back politely declining and added that she had felt attacked when we had met he did his best to keep the peace offering a quasi apology on my behalf while also defending me sorry you felt attacked she didnt mean it in a negative way really shes just blunt fast forward to valentines day oliver took a zumba class with me we had actually had a fight over this as he originally didnt want to take the class with me because he felt emasculated and i was hurt by that we discussed it a lot before he agreed with my pov i filmed a bit of him dancing in class because i was proud and posted it to my story on instagram she responded with im dying i replied back sharing a bit of my struggle with him because im trying to bond with her and thats what i wouldve shared with my own friends about my liferelationship she then became patronizing telling me that i shouldnt be offended that he didnt want to dance because its just not who he is i replied explaining that i was more upset because he actually admitted that he was feeling emasculated which for me is basically sexist and how it does make me wonder if were compatible in the long run then she made this long comment about how coming off strong never changes anyones mind with some more patronizing advice i was furious now and let her know that how she said what she did was not only patronizing but also evident that she didnt read what i had written he and i had calmly discussed the zumba issue she apologized i accepted and we wished each other a happy valentines day yesterday 3 weeks after the ig conversation she texts oliver out of nowhere asking if he knew of our ig conversation he was with me the whole time it was happening and read my messages to her before i even sent them oliver told her yes i saw and she asked why he wasnt upset that i had insulted him again he did a good job at keeping the peace i wasnt insulted because her being harsh means she cares but thanks for having my back penelope she goes ok i just wanted to give you a heads up because she was ranting and what did she want me to do agree with her i figured i would warn you but i guess if you know and youre okay with it as long as she doesnt flat out try to change you and force her opinions on you he assured her i dontwont i found the whole thing incredibly disrespectful to both oliver as in not trusting that he can make his own decisions and our relationship as a whole i get that shes maybe coming from an angle of concerned friend but i dont feel like its her place at all i feel like this would be really weird if she were single she also couldve just been like hey just checking that youre happy in your relationship rather than claiming that i had insulted him because i didnt and trying to subtly insinuate that im a controlling bitch i get really mad thinking about the whole thing because i want to confront her and let her know how i feel about this whole thing i think oliver handled it really well between them but i want to make all these ridiculous boundaries like you cant hang out with her 1 on 1 besides therapy how else do i get over wanting to make oliver choose between me and penelope how do i process feeling like shes trying to undermine me and my relationship i think i feel really torn because a part of me feels obligated to be her friend as he claims shes a big part of his life ie if oliver and i were to get married he would invite her to the wedding i get that a part of me feeling threatened is probably because i dont feel the most secure in my relationship and another part is because i feel like it says oliver and i dont have compatible values if hes friends with people i dont get along with its really tearing me apart right now and by extension my relationship with oliver i will gladly take reminders to sit down and be humble and even more gladly take vindication comments that she overstepped regardless im sure theres plenty of context that im leaving out that id be happy to supply in comments or in a pm thanks for taking the time to delve into my petty personal drama today repost because i forgot the semi colon in the tldr,0

i have nobodyi have literally nobody in my life that currently gives two shits about me but i know the second i would kill myself everyone would be all omg we loved you so much omg why did you do this to us my mom who has always been very openly disappointed in me and the fact that i am not the daughter she always dreamed of having now has the dream daughter she always dreamed of now that my younger sister is 16 loves makeup and clothes and girly things and is flawlessly beautiful and good at everything with a boyfriend and dozens of friends exactly what my mom wanted from me but never got because im ugly have no friends have never been in a relationship with anyone etc youd think i would be the one upset over that but i accepted it and shes the one whos always complained about me dressing ugly and not wearing makeup when again i didnt care and none of my peers cared how i dressed or what i put on my face due to her now having the daughter she always dreamed of and not having to settle for me she has been increasingly treating me like absolute shit the past couple of months like for example despite my sister being on her phone easily 5x more than i am the other day my mom yelled at me and made up some bullshit lies about how because i got frustrated that my phone gave out on me a couple days ago and deleted a bunch of shit im addicted to my phone and essentially need mental help for that whole time im thinking what i actually need is help for my depression but you insist im lying about having depression then have the gall to tell me i need to come to you with my problems i told her to stop twisting shit and making up lies about me and she has now been giving me the silent treatment for about three days this includes her making dinner for everyone else in the family and purposefully not including me thats fine whatever ive known for years how little value my life holds and she has done nothing but affirm that for the entirety of my adolescent years what bothers me is that if i were to actually kill myself like i want to this bitch would turn around and make it all about her and act like shes a victim i know she would do this bc she did the same thing when her own mother died they barely had a relationship yet she made herself the focal point of that womans death it was disgusting i am fully ready at this very moment to kms and would love nothing more than to do it tonight but i dont want anyone especially that bitch to pretend to care,1

first and last post under this usernameits time for me to say goodbye i dont recall the last time i had a modicum of desire to live or get help to live ive seen multiple therapists many who said i was too fudged up for them to see and referred me out ive tried what feels like every antidepressant out there im not close to my family who publicly shamed me about my depression and suicidal tendencies ive lashed out at and pushed away any and all friends i have no romantic relationship i live on my own if i were to have some breaking news to share i literally would have no one to call or text im 350400k in debt from student loans ive failed to get into the one career i was relatively excited to get into x3 i dont have a job lined up and my contract with the current one ends soon i dont know where i will live the one last confidant i had told me we shouldnt talk anymore understandable given how toxic i am and proceeded to share everything with his girlfriend who i have never met and told me to call 911 not understandable and imo a breach of my trust in him ive been dealing with crippling depression and have had to choose between that versus binging and purging a minimum of 10 times a day thanks eating disorder the first and most likely only way ill be found will be due to the stench of my corpse thankfully the coronavirus lockdown is facilitating my death i sincerely hope i dont wake up tomorrow if in the most unfortunate event i do ill have a decision to make ive been told to get help and to commit myself the issue is that it requires me to actually give a crap and want to continue living and want to get better i honestly genuinely have no idea what that even feels like and dont care for it im beyond saving because i didnt want or care to be saved ive been guilt tripped into living and fyi never do that because for someone like me continuing to live is excruciating enough without being guilt tripped or blackmailed i have no desire to live or get better i havent for years ive been a mindless meat suit with little to no integration into or contribution to society for the past 5 years ive already sent out packages and letters to people who were important to me but left i know my death will hurt my immediate family but i literally have no one else in my life that would odd me or even know im gone im selfish and ive been so detached from everyone that frankly i dont care and when im dead i definitely wont care good luck and best of wishes to everyone on here ive seen a lot of posts expressing a will to live and that is a wonderful desire to have i truly hope that you can find and get the help you need by whatever means you are important and you are your strongest advocate please take care of yourselves you do you,1

after a months research and deliberation i finally bought all the furniture for my new apartment i moved into my new place a month back being a stingy shopper i had planned to buy everything used or second hand from a local classifieds website but it all turned out into a painful experience stretching over a month number one me overthinking number two the sellers reply too slow sometimes they wont reply at all they may live far away from my place and its always a headache bargaining prices with them in some cases i saw sellers put yeartwo years old item at the same price as new why would i buy it from you if i can buy new in the same price and then there comes tiny things you need in your apartment cutlery bathroom essentials and what not for that i made multiple trips to various malls hypermarkets wholesale markets whatever people suggested me but everytime i would go not only it would tire me out but i would buy lots of random shit that was like 2 bucks or 5 bucks but not the real stuff which i actually needed and which i actually went to buy because they tend to have a higher price tag and me being the stingy shopper would not buy those but other random shit which would eventually add up to a long bill this constant overthinking over furnishing the apartment and at the same time saving a few bucks made me a maniac over the month my apartment is all messed filled with shopping bags of random shit i was not eating or sleeping well i had no time and motivation to clean up because i still didnt have the furniture i figured that while im stressing about saving 50 bucks by looking at hand me down websites on the dresser that i really needed i had actually already spent that money on takeouts because i was not cookingdoing grocery due to all this drama and random shit as i already mentioned so i just got so sick of it today that i just turned on my laptop went to ikea website and bought all the essential furniture items in my shopping cart that ive been deliberating over for a month after that i went to a local amazon site and just bought all the tinykitchen stuff that i absolutely needed and added everything else to the wish list until i really need it i feel light i know tomorrow i dont have to go to another interior store or hypermarket trying to find the best thing for my tiny apartment all in all it costed me 500600 to furnish the apartment and depending on which economy youre a part of you may say it was expensive or i made a good deal but living in a city where everything is usually expensive id say i made a pretty good deal also considering im all by myself as i just moved to a new city its worth mentioning here that im an expat living in an expat hub city where the rate of people moving out of the country is too high even im not certain how long will i be staying here may be just this year may be the next year so i did have a little buyers remorse peeping out from the corner of my heart telling me tomorrow if i have to go back home i might have to leave everything here the way it is or may be go on to the other side of craigslist and be the seller selling my stuff at half the cost but then i tell myself no matter what happens in the longer run at least im certain about the near future and in the near future i see my self comfortably and peacefully living and growing myself in my tiny apartment,0

thank you hellow u my first important exam this semester is on friday and i already decided that im not gonna be here that day yay no need to study god i hate exams well i mean the 6 hours ones where i just have to sit by myself facing a computer or a paper and a pencil are completely fine but when i have to prove my knowledge and worth to other people for them to judge me when im basically worthless no thank you luckily or not so luckily for my mom i love you mom my mom take a lot of strong pills because of her condition if i just get a little drunk and mix some of them together i should be okay from what ive read and with okay i mean dead obviously and if i die in a lot of pain i probably deserved that too well i actually just wanted to say thank you to you all ive been here on multiple accounts never made a post like this simply because im a pusspuss and too scared of regretting but ive talked to so many amazing people with similar thoughts as mine people ive been so grateful knowing even tho a lot of them were on their way to a better place when i met them i hope well get to party together in a multiverse and be just be happy and free or something like that people whove really changed my thoughts about a lot of stuff but yeah this subreddit is a beautiful place harsh at the same time tho but it has really given me a lot of insight and talking to some of these people has really made me feel something for the first time in a long time so thank you for that to you who even care to wonder what went wrong in my life lemme try and explain long story short ive always been this shy unconfident alien caring a lot about how people were seeing me school has always been a very important part of my life it was the only thing i was kinda good at i wanted to be the best and i was for quite a long time i did everything to perfection i got straight as and i was so motivated god knows why when i got into what we here see as high school 3 year period before university everything changed i was not like the other girls from my class i felt like they were so much older than me they were drinking partying just having the time of their lives i was just me reading books and my biggest worry was that people wouldnt like me i tried to become just good enough anorexia hit me hard my brain wasnt what it used to and that ruined me i started fainting in class and at museums at home etc but i was doing fine i was still getting good grades i was still doing everything to perfection in the end of 2nd year my parents and teachers decided that this wasnt healthy i mean looking back now i was pretty damn destroyed but oh well them telling me to take a break ruined everything i was strong enough to keep going i felt like the biggest failure i was the biggest failure still am still feel it i lost all motivation i still this day wish i could go back and just me that me i started taking classes again last winter ive never felt so worthless and i find everything pointless if everything went as planned i would be ready for uni next summer heh i guess not to study astrophysics to be exact tho space has always been my thing where i felt safe darkness and with the stars and planets as my buddies and oh lets not forget the black holes too but lemme be real i have a great life i have the most amazing and supporting parents i have the best brothers and thats the thing ive already peeked my life can only go downhill from here and it will fuck me over i will keep failing ill start losing people i am just not a good person and i take everything for granted i feel so guilty and i dont deserve to be here every other person would be more than grateful to be in my position but im just not i dream about more i want multiverses i wanna travel in space and time i wanna touch the stars okay not touch them but you know what i mean i hope well i dont know what else to say dont even know if anyone reads this but thank you if you do and oh one last thing please please send me your favorite songs that would be so appreciated i need to blast my ears with good music till the moment i die thanks,1
bringing my phone into wc at work throwaway account yadayada no this is not a i dropped my expensive 150 phone into the toilet bowl and my english is not good so sorry about that to start with you need to know about my job im an editor at a certain nonenglish news outlet the only one left after everyone else just quit after about 10 months under a new chief editor but they doesnt bother to find anyone new to fill the gap so its all on me i write edit and publishing meanwhile the chief editor daily routine at work is coming at 10am and going home at 1230pm this happened yesterday at work so being the good employee i am when i started hearing the call of nature at about 2pm i take a glance at the list of article still need to be edited and approved nothing so i pick up my phone and step into the toilet while sitting inside the private corner to take drop a shit and browsing reddit on my phone a facebook chat message come up on my screen from the chief editor at this hour she is already home or maybe somewhere else to take care of her personal business while typing this im blessed with the knowledge of hindsight but back then i didnt if i just ignored that facebook chat bubble and reply it after im done nothing would have happened and this post wont be made but being the genuine good employee i am in an industry that you need to rush your news out before everyone else for click i tapped on it to check what it was where are you why didnt you edit and publish the collaborators news mind you the collabs news wasnt there when i picked up my phone at this time i cant pretending like i havent seen the message so i need to answer for some stupid reason i think it wouldnt be approriate to just drop the whole shitty business into the chat and im stupid too so i put i just got up and ran to the bank on the other side of the street thinking its just a small little thing that wouldnt harm anyone this is the bank that my company use to make salary payment but my response trigger something on a scale that i can never predicted why are you going to the bank in work hour duh because bank only open at work hour i guess why didnt you tell me even if i really went to the bank i still wouldnt tell her because she is at home after this month go quit the job welp too bad whatever so after im done i packed my bag and going home i just finished letting my employer know i will quit at the end of the month already worked as a part time writer for some other agency that pay nearly twice as much as current full time editor job and already planned to quit at the end of the month so its no loss but still it could be a smoother quitting if i just honestly blatantly going with im in the toilet the employer is a nice guy with multiple businesses and i like him but i dont think he can going far in this field with a chief editor like that,0

wait wut ok so this thing happened to me and its kinda stupid so i thought you guys might want to hear it alright so i was going through youtube you know as you do and i saw this video named the family friendly noose songurl so its a song about how to tie a noose pretty self explanatory anyway i thought it was funny as the world is just going to shit so i watched and sent it to a friend with this exact words bro does yt want me to commit suicide this showed up in my recommended and apparently he still has his phone monitored so his mommy called my mother saying that i was thinking of hanging myself and that i was desperate a day before i was asking for username ideas for another app and he suggested hoeza134 and i said honestly ima try if i get too desperate do i guess they got it from that but they twisted it into me being highly suicidal and desperate to end it so they broke into my room fbi style took away my phone my tablet to monitor all my text and search history i had to argue for 30 minutes to get it back after she called my siblings telling them i was suicidal and to talk to me now their thinking of monitoring my phone and blocking everything that can be seen offensive i won the argument after two hours and showing them my texts multiple times she did not inform my siblings however so i had to explain it to them so yeah thats it if you read this far then here have a cookie have a good day,0

im giving uptrigger warning hi before i start talking about everything i want you to know that im not an open person at all everything happens to me i keep it inside of me i dont share at all because i believe that im a strong person and i dont need anyone and no one can help me and me posting and writing about me right now means i have reached my maximum desperation level suicide is easier for me than talking about whats on my mind but here i am talking i have attempted suicide on 1st april 2018 i hanged myself with the belt and i passed away for few minutes the house was empty my brother got home and he managed to save me before doing this attempt i was thinking all the time in every way that i could have a reason that im not seeing to be alive even after attempting suicide i still think that i should do it again to be honest my mom gonna travel in april again and the house gonna be empty and im preparing myself for committing suicide again and for the last time the reason is i have nothing no life no help no reason no job no college i can go to really nothing and if you wanna know why and how its simple its because i live in iraq i been living in iraq since the day i was born and that is my curse i been trying to leave since the moment i started walking iraq passport is before the last worst passport in the world baghdad the capital is the worst city in the world to live in since 2016 i guess theres no chance for me here i tried and believe me when i say it i tried everything to leave to run away to work to find new ways but theres always a close road for me i cant find another place to live in i have no life here no father he left us since i was 9 years old when i was 9 i was scared and sad because that happened so i started to listen to english music basically eminem and i fell in love with him even tho i dont know what he was saying so i promised myself to learn the language and understand every song he makes thats how i speak english now also it is my curse to be honest because english made me what i am now open minded guy who thinks and knows many things who knows how stupid and ignorant his community is who knows how everyone around is so dumb and not humans at all because no one here talk about emotions no one care no one thinks about the other i learned a lot because of my english language and i believed when i was a kid me knowing the language and getting better at it will be my ticket out of here so i kept focusing on it for years every day every hour in every song till the moment came and i found out that its not even my ticket and i cant leave because i only speak english i cant stand spending another year in this place at all i cant be myself i cant even do my hobbies and find what im really good at because theres no right places for such things here im giving up and i dont know its the end of the line for me here i thought about sharing because i thought maybe nothing is changing because i keep everything inside of me so here i am lost and dont know how to live like a human and at a least have a home,1

guys my ex said young stalin was cute a week before she broke up with me really makes you,0
a rant and maybe a ventthis is prolly gonna be long one just stay with me here please also sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammar ive been crying while writing this so ive been feeling really depressed and suicidal for way more than a month now but not sure how long one of my friends asked me out and we dated for a week until she broke up with me saying i cant be trusted and how i broke her when i tried my best to treat her right this happened on halloween and when i finally got home after hanging out with my friends i went to my room and cried myself to sleep ive been feeling like killing myself or severely hurting myself since no i dea why i keep thinking that but i dont find any positive reasons to live and all my friends and surprisingly my ex none of them are want me to die but i think theyre just lying and trying to keep me here so they can humiliate me and make me suffer even more than i already am with a busy and stressful life at school and problems at home i dont want to stay where i am i just want to go missing then to another country and if i still feel like killing myself id just do it where my friends wont know where i went i know i sound selfish as hell for wanting to leave them here but i cant think of a better reason and i dont want them to see my dead body and having to deal with knowing im dead and theyd prolly be traumatized with seeing me so happy the last time i talked to them ive been self harming really bad since i got dumped to the point all the cuts will leave awful scars after i stopped for about 2 weeks since i broke the blade by accident the cuts healed and i showed them what i did because i guess i tried showing them what happens after leaving me alone like that with my already alarming amount of suicidal thoughts she doesnt like it that i say anything about the relationship but i say it by accident and dont mean to harm her im just reflecting why ive been feeling way more suicidal after what happened because of the problems at home i started cutting again but i broke the other blade aswell so i couldnt do anything a week ago i was in pe when i got hit in the leg right to the cuts and couldnt continue playing i went to the bathroom to check the cuts and it hurt so bad i almost started crying which resulted in my slightly bright colored pants to get a bit red from the blood the teacher asked if everything was alright so i had to tell her what i did after class she asked me if it was alright that she told the school counselor and i agreed because my friends blackmailed me into telling ive been slowly getting a bit better by writing down why i feel depressed and now im writing it here not the same words but the same meaning ive been falling back down again and really bad i ordered a boxcutter online and now im waiting for it to arrive so if i feel like it i can just cut my throat open and die knowing i wont be a burden to everybody anyways thanks for reading this i appreciate it that you precious individual took your time to read something as useless as this im posting this in hopes of feeling a bit better have a great day though,1
guy seems in love first meetup i just wanna know if im overly analyzing this situation or not yesterday afternoon i was walking around and this guy stopped me and said i was pretty we talked and exchanged numbers and insta he was just really touchy like wanting me to sit on his lap when we were sitting down he would repeatedly take my phone from my hand to the point that i almost tackled him he looked through my photos and snooping on my phone at that point i had to just put my phone away before i put it away he saw i was on dating apps and wanted me to delete it i have some male friends strictly male friendsnothing has or will ever happen inappropriately not code or anything like that and he wanted me to cut all the males out my life this morning he facetimed me and was asking to see me he made me get out bed and wanted to see that i was getting ready i told him its too early but he didnt seem to care im not a morning person he said to dress appropriately when i see him not even 24 hours passed and hes saying what i can and cant wear yesterday i was just wearing shorts and a tank top and he said he didnt want anyone seeing my thighs hes just coming off too intense for me he has a incurable disease who his ex gave him i feel hes just trying to get with anyone he can he said hes scared to trust me and that he really wants to be with me does this sound like controlling behavior,0

my teacher is looking out for me hardcore so you know how in tv shows or movies theres that teacher that looks out for one of the characters like they will bail them out of jail or like the will remove a shitty mark or something i honestly thought that was an acting thing but this teacher is seriously something else basically im doing my last project of the semester and i had the stomach flu for about a week and im pretty bad at this project there was absolutely no way i was going to have this done in time and i probably wouldve failed the class today to my surprise i sat down at my desk and my robot was completely different it was finished he smiled and told me huh looks like a miracle happened this guy who doesnt owe me anything and who i argue with all the time took the time to re assemble my whole project so i could pass this isnt even the first time hes covered for me either i was really late to my second period class and i told my teacher that i was doing something for my last period teacher the teacher finished my robot and she asked me to get a note from him confirming this and of course he came through with the save i dont know why but hes just taken me under his wing hes a great dude just really made my day amazing especially after getting an earful from my second period teacher telling me im not going anywhere edit shouldve mentioned this final project is worth 30 of my mark,0
sometimes it feels good to lose a friendship when i became friends with this person i was very insecure in myself i was scared of being judged and rejected but ironically i became friends with a person who acted very standoffish and judgmental we ended up becoming roommates and i was equally excited and insecure we hung out initially wed go to parties and what not but eventually we started going down our own path a bit more over that year i decided to focus on myself i worked on addressing my insecurities and just becoming more comfortable in my own skin during this process i realized i dont want a friendship where i cant be myself i owned my hobbies and my alwayschanging weird taste in music and my friends and my style i learned to be proud of the things that made me feel like me now i wasnt blaring annoying music in our room i just didnt feel the need to hide as soon as i sensed her judgment long story short her hot and cold attitude has just been cold for the past month or two shes been rude and honestly just weird we cant make small talk like anytime i try its just awkward as fuck and she gives me the cold shoulder so i guess i lost a friend i clarified with her to make sure i didnt do anything wrong or offend her and she said no but losing a friend by being myself really shows me how much ive grown this past year i used to be terrified of rejection and a peoplepleaser so im proud of myself for not playing other peoples games and investing my energy into things that are better for me,0

a little advice would be nice extra long nsfw sensitive i 24m have a peculiar relationship with a friend 22f and ill try my best to explain it tldr made a new friend but met while she had a streak of infidelity but didnt bother me at the time had a brief casual sexual relationship but she wanted to date and i said no because of the whole met you while you were cheating on your boyfriend at the time with another guy then moved onto me thing but remained good friends she got a boyfriend later on and they recently broke up and she came back into my life full swing and i think over time ive developed deep feelings towards her then i told her dont know where to go from here in order to grasp the concept of this ill have to rewind back to the summer of 2017 when we first met i was at my apartment doing what any normal guy would do during a 100deg summer day in virginia prepare for a day of fishing and drinking beer riverside i shoot some texts around if anyone would like to come with and i get a slew of responses yeah what time sorry got work maybe next time dude whose number new phone my friend mike says that hell come if he can bring some girls he recently met and i say sure sweet im single at this time btw mike walks into the apartment with 3 girls my roommate and best friend marcus are just noodling on our guitars in the main room while our other friends are playing tekken 7 to pass the time while we wait for everyone to get the apartment this is the first time i met l we all get up and introduce ourselves to the girls exchange names pleasantries typical questions you ask people in college im already graduated and shes in education program to be a teacher after weve been chatting for awhile the next words she says to me are op you know youre actually really hot right i dont quite know how to respond so i just thank her and tell her its the first time ive gotten that before and i tell her shes beautiful too i find out she models part time and she shows me really professional headshots and others modelling designer clothes side note i know im not an ugly person but ive never thought of myself as hot or super attractive im just a guy who goes to work and plays videogames as a hobby i typically keep to myself to the point that most people think i dislike them when i first meet them warning some explicit content and sensitive material coming up ok so we go to the river and have a good time nothing really happens i catch a few fish downstream then we all stand and float in the river to escape the heat and are drinking we all say lets go back to the apartment and do some real partying its a saturday we get back to the apartment put on some music play some multiplayer games and have a great time with new faces l gets a little promiscuous when drunk she comes up to me again after wed both had a good bit to drink and says youre so cute i cant get over it pulls me in and kisses me im a little shocked i look around the room for mike because she had been on him at the river and kissing him since wed left but he didnt seem bothered he even joined in when a couple people went oooooo and we all laughed she kisses me and mike a few more times that night i get a little uncomfortable that shes just going back and forth but oh well wrap up the party and everyone goes home call up mike the next morning and was like who the hell is that girl you brought over and are you guys serious he confides in me that she actually has a boyfriend that isnt him and also they have a casual sexual relationship on the side so shes cheating on the guy who calls her a girlfriend with my friend and is making out with other men like me im kind of confused on the dynamic and decide to back off but its not the last time we interact fast forward two weeks and she broke up with her boyfriend and is still hanging around mike until one of the last days of summer happens they get into a huge argument about one of mikes friends because he blew her off to go hang out with him and l doesnt like this friend because hes annoying they get into a screaming match and she texts me asking if she can come over to my apartment to cool off and get away from him since shes actually staying over there with him for that weekend i say sure im just doing what i do normally and wanted to give her a judgement free zone she comes in im in the office portion playing bdo and she spins my chair around and starts really making out with me putting her hand on my jeans making extremely forward advances i stop her and ask what the f is going on and she says mike was being an ahole and she just wants me that she was dumb for staying with him for too long and that she always wanted to do this she then continues and i stop her again and i ask whats going to happen is mike going to walk in here and kick my a in a jealous rage im not that good friends with mike at the time were fine now i dont want to step on any toes and i want to make sure this girl isnt just finding some escape from her problems in men like i escape some of mine with videogames so we have sex despite my better judgement mike walks in the front door drunk we usually keep out front door unlocked because were friendly people and dont mind visitors hes yelling and me and l are cuddling in bed i walk out of my room shes still in there getting dressed mike its 10pm at night and your drunk go to bed dude he starts pushing me around in my living room which i am not okay with at all since it is my own home but i do nothing mike is in a rage and keeps saying i wanna give that b a piece of my mind shes a cheating slut and im not mad at you op im mad at her for being such a b i know shes here i just wanna talk to her i tell him that yes she is here but doesnt want to see you just leave it alone you and her made this choice she comes out from my room and shes like mikey oh my god go home its over now mike is getting even louder and yelling and pushing me to get closer to l and i think he tries to swing i tell him lets just talk about this calmly outside and sort this out eventually i get a little fed up with his screaming and i say f this im going inside ill let you two sort it out the moment i start walking away he choke slams l into the side of the brick building and i turn around and dislocate his shoulder and choke him out till he almost passes out and my roommate escorts mike back to his house while i tend to l in mine side note ive practiced krav maga for about 10 years which is why i refused to fight him until i absolutely had to hindsight 2020 maybe if i did something sooner l wouldnt have gotten hurt so weve been through a lot together that night basically changed our lives we carried on a purely physical relationship for a couple weeks until she asks about dating im hesitant based on what happens and i tell her i dont know if youll actually be loyal to me she says fine forget i asked and we kind of stop there she finds a new boyfriend and they date all the way up until a month ago we remain in contact hanging out a few times and to my surprise when we go out shes not kissing with other guys any men that approach her shell be polite and flirt a little but if they get handsy or go for a kiss she redirects them to her friends who are single and ends the conversation with them i start a new relationship with an ex i had awhile ago completely awful idea and we come to each other for advice when things get rough i end up getting used by the ex so she could light a fire under the seat of her old ex to get some passion back so im single again for awhile then l calls me one night and says her boyfriend broke up with her cause his mother didnt approve and threatened him with a shun if he kept dating l 2 weeks go by and she comes down for new years to celebrate downtown where i live and stays the night the moment she comes in she gives me a huge hug and a kiss and says she missed doing that for a long time we go out she gets a drink from the bar and before she can even make it back to the booth a guy approaches her and they start hitting it off cool l is back to her old self its really nice to see we end the night on a good note and i give her my bed and i sleep on the couch in the middle of the night she pulls me into my bed and we cuddle no sex she leaves the next morning and says she had a great time i did too we talked about a lot of things and how were so lucky to be each others friends we basically know almost everything about each other shes back at school now which i still live near so were in close proximity and were slowly kicking off another sexual relationship but i think i want something more after everything weve been through after all the things weve shared with each other acceptance weve offered and judgement free spaces weve given so that we can grow i think i may actually be ready to give her the best version of myself that she already knows so well we got drunk last night together nothing unusual but i got emotional and i told her l you know when i drop some truth bombs and you tell me oh op thats why i love you haha and i say yeah i love you too i think i might actually mean it and i teared up a little bit in front of her cause i knew i felt it was right and shes said i know and i walked her home and told her id talk to her later been thinking about it all day today and needed to get it off my chest sorry for the super long post forgive me and thank you all so much for any advice you give,0

listening to radiohead instead of train announcements this actually happened last december but im yet to make a bigger screwup on public transport and thats saying a lot so i live in england and last december one of my hockey teams had a night out planned in blackpool and i needed to go to preston to get some stuff done and on from there its a direct train so it should have been simple i got my hair cut had some food and got to the train station in plenty of time i checked the boards and the train was on time got to the platform and put my earphones in like usual this wasnt a route i had done before but what could go wrong its a direct train so long as i watched the boards and listened out for the announcements if the board showed any changes it would be fine i would arrive in plenty of time to get picked up from the station and driven to join my teammates at the accommodation from whence we would walk to revolution to start the night off there were no changes to the train platform and no delays displayed and the right train appeared on the platform i got on and it all seemed to be going fine i didnt recognise the place names but yk i hadnt done this route about 15 minutes in my dad called me to say findafriend was showing me going a different way than expected and insisted i check with someone i sighed and asked a nearby lady if this was the train to blackpool north and she said yes all good i got increasinglysuspicious though as i passed lancaster which i could have sworn was the wrong direction but i stuck it out for a bit and checked maps to see where i was headed and thats when i realised i had verily fucked up to cut a long story short what had happened was i had technically got on the right train but me with my earphones in hadnt heard the announcement to say the train is split into two carriages and that the carriage i was on wasnt the one going to blackpool northit was the one going to the lakes i ended up in carnforth and had to get back to preston and go on from there on the flip side though i ended up being really late to the accommodation and was just going to get a taxi to revolution but it turned out my teammates had decided to wait for me made my day if anyone can work out how to attach a photo on mobile then lmk and ill attach a map showing the routes but if not a google search of blackpool to carnforth via preston will show you what you need tldr was supposed to go on a team night out in blackpool ended up 40 miles away in pretty much the lake district,0

i gave up on life 5 years ago because im uglyim male aged 30 look younger 182cm tall 1cm under 6ft skinny af lanky with long legs etc pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin never touched a girl or even had more than a few words spoken to me by one so yea in the looks department its over i never leave the house and havnt since 2015 between 20122015 i had a bar jobi had girls like me and i wasnt ugly then facially i got older and ugly i met some amazing people but also some horrors horrible women whod call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers i worked with the good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times by a fat ugly overweight bitch heres an example i serve a table of 6 ladies in their 40s food and try being polite and helpfully nice as i can not one of them says thanks and they practically snatch the cutlery and plates of food from my hands when i pass it to them when they finished eating a good looking guy i work with went over to get the plates and they stacked the plates up for him were all saying thanks and were laughing and joking with him he was there for a few minutes fucking hags in the end i got fed up and left and havnt left the house since to let ageing hit me like a train before i had that job i had the same job advisor for 6 months and she was the same i was very quiet but also really polite and respectful and it got me nowhere she was still snotty and bitchy with me and would totally ignore me if i asked her advice when i needed it but yet youd see other guys who were aggressive and disrespectful but because they were hunkymanly and attractive shed open up easily to them and be very nice with them and help them no problem this gave me trust issues i do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and thats the same women staring me down because im skinny like its my fault theyre fat other guys i work with staring at me with a wtf is that face and overweight short girls calling me a ming whatever that means its great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and i think its nice when someone looks past what i look like its funny how i succumbed to judging peoples niceness to how they judge me on my looks or not but there isnt many like that about i eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner i feel better still hidoeus nevertheless a comment on here once i asked about my hair one comment said hes clearly balding and hidoeus btw and it got upvoted 17 times i drink whiskey every night watching cartoons and im starting to get chest pains also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 at work and she was gorgeous too you should of seen her instagram at the time it was fire she worked in the bar with me i was 24 then i looked nice then you should see me now its depressing waking up every morning crying through sleepy half shut eyes i basically live upstairs watching netflix everyday and smoking weed in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or youngerolder have looks on their side and a life to go with it funny how most of them are cocky as hell and very arrogant and the girls love it i have a friend whos like that hes cocky as hell and thinks every girls he walks past fancies him and you wouldnt believe how the girls love that persona on him too its not about getting girls for me but i could care less about not getting sex tbh etc its juts the restricted life i have because im ugly and seeing good looking dudes treated better even when theyre complete cocky arrogant assoles lookism man edit iv tried stopping the whiskey every night in a pathetic attempt to look less ugly again but i dont think it will work,1

almost cutting my dick off with an angle grinder before today i considered myself to use the best practices when utilizing power tools i used to be a diesel technician and have done a decent amount of metal fabrication i had a change of careers 5 years ago and became a paramedic i have seen a couple gnarly accidents when people arent safe one would think i would be the last guy to have an accident today my neighbor asked for me to cut a 34 inch steel bar for a tractor of his i agreed and took the bar back to my shop where my angle grinder is i locked it in the vise with confidence and slapped on newer cut off disc as i cut downwards into the bar i realized that metal dust was fragmenting into my tool box i decided to cut upwards into the bar to prevent this if youre not familiar with using an angle grinder you wouldnt know that you never want to cut upwards into something like this i did i was being an idiot i was 90 into my upwards cut of the steel rod when suddenly the weight of the bar caused it to pinch the cut off disc this instantaneously launched the angle grinder back at me without a second to realize it was happening the grinder chassis grabbed my shirt and swung with the force of an nfl kicker into my family jewels this forced me to let go of the grinder and keel forward in pain letting go of the grinder allowed it grab my tshirt with the disc and pulled towards my groin i grabbed grinder chassis but at this point it was pulling my shirt into it harder than i could fight i felt humming through my arms as the motor on the grinder locked up afraid to let go of the grinder i pulled it away from my abdomen stretching my shirt beyond limit it felt like i was holding a pit bull by its jaws as it tried to maul me i managed to quickly back up pulling the power cord out of the wall socket the garage went silent i had a vietnam style flash back to every final destination scene i have watched i will never ever make an upwards cut into an unsupported anything ever again i attached photos of my shirt and just how close i came to amputating my own dick i was horrified and considering i use the angle grinder every single day i am now terrified with the fact i did something so stupid for the record i wore my safety glasses tldr today i used an angle grinder improperly and almost caused potential penile amputation the aftermath showing me how close i was to becoming the eunuch from game of thronesurl,0

i 30f found out my boyfriend 29m cousins daughter is his actual daughter i 30f found out my boyfriend 29m cousins daughter is his actual daughter my boyfriend of 25 years is very very close to his cousins one girl in particular but it never bothered me he loves his daughter very very much which i always thought was very sweet recently he started calling her his daughter which i took as a term of endearment calling her that was not that surprising since i knew how very close and loving they are with each other but tonight i was in a bad mood and said hey its cute sometimes but not every time shes not your daughter and he got so serious all of a sudden and told me that she is actually his daughter i kept giving him many chances to say hes kidding because i could not believe it but he just kept getting more serious as if he understands that im right to be hurt and saying stuff like we cant change the past or i promise there is nothing left there implying that he had romantic feelings at one point or it would be better if you continue to believe that she is not my daughter so other than being disgusted that hed knock up his cousin which is not the worst thing here cause his grandparents are first cousins and one of his uncles had a kid with his cousin so it is not that entirely far fetched that this might happen i am so hurt because he had been lying to me for soo long and also i dont care if this is his cousin the rule about past exs or people weve slept with is that they must be completely removed from our lives which ive stayed painfully true to and not only do they talk every day but he is oddly for me close to this woman so to sum up he has this illegitimate 7 year old daughter born of incest of whom ive been believing is his cousins daughter for 2 and a half years and he is so extremely close with his cousin still even after theyve slept together which is a big no no and hurts a great deal am i crazy is this pretty bad am i within my right to ask him to restrict his contact with her especially if it is not related to his child i feel that theres just no trust left here and my instinct is to run away has anyone experienced something like this before is my response normal im mostly looking to vent here and maybe get some understanding responses but if anyone has any advice please share i want to run away i still have like 2 hope that this might be some horribly cruel joke of which i dont know if i can get over cause it took a lot for me to get to this point of believing that this is actually true and he actually let me stay in the bathroom for 3 hours and counting without ever saying it was a joke,0

ex 28m broke nc asking for me back and now i 24f need a slap of reddit reality he says he misses me and cant move on that hes never been this messed up over a break up in his life and would i please meet with him im so angry at him for contacting me i had been doing great the past few weeksi hadnt thought about him at all and now suddenly i cant get him out of my head the day we broke up i was done i prepared myself to never speak to him again even though that would mean i would never get any answers about why he suddenly turned into an absolute ass straight out of the blue after being mr perfectbf for 6 months wed been friends for five years too yet in the span of a week it went from amazingdream to totalshit and it felt like he kind of just threw me away even if i was the one to actually end it he didnt seem to care i think its what he wanted i was determined to stop feeling hurt even though there were a few times when i wanted to contact him so badly i always pulled through and finally after several months of feeling horribly empty lonely and heartbroken i started moving on everything started looking up for me recently and so many new things have happened to me since the break up i had a casual fling with someone new i am killing it at work in a new job and doing great in my first year of grad school i bought a new truck after being carless for several months while we were together i just got my first place a little house in an awesome part of the city after only ever living at home with my parents on top of all of that my lifelong battle with major depression has finally started to get under control i know i should not care anymore why is it so hard all of a sudden i was over so this but its all blown back in with a vengeance i am so angry that ive allowed this to set me back after so much time reddit tell me what you are supposed to do when this happens has anyone else been through this do i just try to forget it again or do i meet with him and see what he has to say clearly he wants to get back together and i dont know if i want that because i dont know if he even thinks he did anything wronghe sure didnt apologize back then he has never known how to admit when he makes a mistake and i dont know that thats changed the other reason is really shallow but the fact is he has herpes and i dont want to make a worthless irreversible mistake if this falls apart all over again so why even bother any advice or thoughts would help a lot my friends hate him after what happened so i cant figure out who to talk to about this 95 of the rest of the time he was absolutely perfect and i loved him to bits tldr perfectbf of 6 monthsfriend of 5 yrs out of the blue told me his first exs vagina was better then mine right after sex didnt apologize ignored me for a week and when i broke up with him over it he gave me back every single piece of crap i had left at his house and seemed totally cool with it 5 months later ive moved on or so i thought now hes begging me for forgiveness and i feel like im suddenly back at square one i need help on how to move forward or just a slap of reality from the ruthless and usually correct rrelationships community,0

please stop putting soaps in ur coochie first of all lol you dont necessarily need to even use soap at all to wash the kitty cat just plain water does the trick and its actually the most recommended but if you are not someone that is comfortable with just washing with water or you think you still smell without using soap then use a mild soap with no fragrance or very little tooo many little kids and grown teens lol are improperly caring for themselves vagisil douches blah blah are not necessary showering once or twice a day and washing the cooter is fine these chemically produced products are not good for your vag unless recommended by your doctor do not use these products just plain soap or water also if you are properly washing keeping clean and still smell with the exception of humid areasathletes exercise physical exertion or production of sweat then go to a doctor every vag has a smell but if its something that is pungent and doesnt smell like normal go to the doctor pls and do not stick or put soap or chemicals or unsafe objects into your vagina please no how to wash with warm water or mild soap use cloth or hand to open the lips labia and wash the creases of your vag as well as raising up your libs to expose the clithood and gently clean the area rinse dry its just that ive seen and heard a lot of people that dont actually know how to care for themselves and just some advice,0

new girlfriend wants to take a step back needing to vent and maybe ask for some advice tldr new girlfriend feels shes not ready to commit to a relationship right now needed to vent and ask for some advice trying to stay positive about things right now were longdistance 8 hour drive not impossible but certainly not ideal we actually have a trip semiplanned the status of which is kind of up in the air right now didnt feel like a good time to bring it up met on facebook through a coworker weve been talking since the beginning of april and it went really well talked nonstop for a month or so and as things started to escalate she started to feel weird she got out of an abusive situation a little while ago and we were starting to bring back bad memories from that for her so she wanted to take a step back few days pass and things are back to normalmostly shes not texting me as much which i attribute to her needing her space of course thats okay few more days pass and she tells me that she wants to be official nothing really changes but its all good this was two weeks ago sometimes i dont hear from her much for a day or two but every time i try to give her the space she needs and things go back to normal after a bit she tells me today that she went to her first therapy appointment and shes realized that she cant commit to a relationship right now for mental health reasons along with work and whatnot too much going on essentially thats totally fine i dont want her to do something thats detrimental to herself for my benefit of course will include a snippet of this part of the conversation quoted at the bottom for added context feel free to ignore i ask her if she still wants to be with me later and she says of course i ask her to promise me that if she changes her mind about us later she wont let me keep hope where there is none she again said of course im still pretty confident that its gonna go well eventually i know it hasnt been long but it really seems to me like i can trust she wouldnt lie about still wanting to be with me in the future and that she willwould keep her word about letting me know if theres no hope for me to have any more i honestly have a really really good feeling about this longterm idk just a lame time right now dont really have anyone else to talk to kinda nervous about the future last time she wanted to take a step back i was really anxious in the following days cause things were really weird and i just really hope thats not the case this time i know i need to chill out a little bit but its hard right now this is usually the bit where i would bow out but somethings telling me not to this time im trying really hard to stay positive so comments that help me with that would be greatly preferable there may come a time when i need to hear the opposite but i dont think thats right now like i said i still have a really good feeling about this on the longterm im just having some trouble with the shortterm i guess my purpose for making this post apart from just getting it off my chest is to ask for some advice on what to do here apart from the obvious giving space and putting the whole being together thing on the back burner for now at least any signs that may not be so obvious that i should look for to tell me its going one way or the other keeping in mind that since its long distance our only conversation will be texting have any of you been on one side or the other of a situation like this and it ended up working out stuff like that thanks for reading if youre skipping the immediate context below even if you dont comment just having this community here so i can get this in the open should be tremendously helpful her so i had my first therapy appointment and ive realized that at this very moment i cant commit to being in a relationship i still wanna talk and be friends but theres too much to focus on not just with my mental health but work and other things i kinda need to take some time me okay i understand please dont be upset or discouraged youre soo so wonderful really im trying and the last thing i wanna do is hurt or disappoint you ccm596 i know do you still wanna be with me later of course just not right now ya know me hey we both know we have great things ahead of us right so if we need to put that on hold for now thats okay i have all the time in the world she heart eyes reacted to this one thank you youre welcome i hope im not overstepping here but i have a really good feeling about us and as long as you see me in your future then i do too heart eyes react again no response me again one more thing and then we can talk about something else lol justpromise that if later on you change your mind about us you wont let me keep hope where there is none ya know i trust you that you feel the same way i do but i just need to ask that of you for my sanity haha her of course like i said i know i need to chill out about things especially since this just happened today but thats part of what im hoping to accomplish by posting here thanks for reading even if you dont comment,0

am i 28m being toxic and overly sensitive to my long distance 27f girlfriend by calling her out when she speaks poorly to me hello my girlfriend is in europe and im in the us when she wakes up its about 3am here relevant fact recently her and i spoke about fixing our sleep schedules for the last year ive stayed up late to be able to talk to her and also because for years before i tend to be just a night owl its my habit i am currently finding out sleep issues are possibly affecting my health and its been something her and i talked about also she believes her sleeping schedule is bad ive constantly reassured her that i do not blame her i choose to stay up late and its not her fault so recently i told her im making efforts to fix it anyway she always texts in her morning which is 3am for me i admire our time together talking and texting were long distance afterall i only get a little time to talk each day she texted me on one platform i checked it and she saw i was online and asked why arent you sleeping i said just woke for a second she said i see d me i go back to sleep her okok 3 goodnight me goodnight my love simple nothing bad 30 minutes later she replies to a big text chat we had the previous day on a different messenger and i hear the vibrations of my phone and wake up and look i couldve gone back to sleep but curiosity gets me and like i said i want to know what she says she sees im online again and sends new messages saying why arent you sleeping bad my name xd from now on im not going to text you because i wake you up and instad of tryiong to sleep you just play on your phone _ i read those last few messages and felt a little hurt 1 she actually means things like this 2 imo it shows a lack of appreciation for the relationship 3 it hurts me when she talks to me like a child i do see that in her opinion she claimed she said that out of care for my health she doesnt want me sleeping bad anymore i do see her opinion as valid and full of care but the manner in how she decides to say it gets me upset i replied i just hear vibrations is all im sitting here feeling bad that it feels like she doesnt appreciate that im up for her but more so the ultimatum of threatening to not text me makes me feel iike she talks down to me she said i know and i woke you up i dont wanna be the reason your sleeping schedule is fucked you should put your phone is silent mode before you sleep this is tame and mild but ive never blamed her for ruining my sleep schedule in the past recently and a while ago she goes through depressed moments and tantrums about her life she takes the blame out on me sometimes and has said things to me that project that she feels our texting and one phone call a day is a time burden to her we discussed that but im thinking this again in the moment mainly tho this is very mild in her tone currently but shes had a really bad habit of talking down to me disrespectfully and without thought or care ive grown tired of it ive read that those habits need to be corrected starting with me calling her out on it so she begins to learn so ive been attempting to do such lately when she speaks out so i decided to voice what i was thinking openly here i reply im not a child if i wake up to check my phone then i wake up to check dont hold that against me saying youll stop texting is pretty harsh to say to your partner btw but youll do what you want ima go back to sleep i thought that would lead to an apology for her tone did i speak wrong i turn my phone on silent then try to sleep this led to her spamming my phone with one word texts trying to be cute saying she didnt mean to upset me and shes just making a solution and she ends with are you asleep or you just being butthurt even tho i didnt mean to make you mad you just took it offensive because this is so fashionable these days i read the last part as a huge redflag for me by fashionable these days she meant because recently when she attacks me or acts out of line i try to be logical and address it how its not healthy for the relationship the times when i thought i addressed it correctly and came to a mutual understanding with her she actually didnt come to a true understanding so i called her and the conversation went mild at the start in the conversation i expressed that i get that she feels guilty and cares for me but likewise if i wake up for a little its because i want a little time with her she doesnt need to look negatively on this i told her that saying the ultimatum comes across as not valuing the relationship the continuance of the phone talk is a topic for a new thread itself i tried to stay logical but in the talk she spoke down to me a bunch the biggest things she said was i feel iike a mother taking care of a kid right now im dealing with a child youre being a little bitch each rude thing i told her that shes being so damn disrespect to me and she needs to stop speaking to me like this she has this habit of during serious conversations she can only be sarcastic with mean jokes and forced laugh at everything it felt like a mess i tried to express how my biggest dislike in people is when they disrespect me and she told me if so many people dont respect you then theres something wrong with you i ended up trying to talk about how she comes across never to value me or my opinion while im always verbally talking her up and being so proud of her for whats shes accomplished and thinking highly of her i tried to express that its both how and what she says to me that isnt healthy and i expressed that shes closed off to letting me lead and be the man in the relationship she got a little serious and said that shes always been alone and dealing with people who treat her poorly so she defends herself first i ended up saying sorry for starting the whole argument and being sensitive and for also making her late for her plans saying this lowered my masculinity value a lot i guess in the end we came to a quasiunderstanding though although i tried to make it a bigger conversation to try and communicate what we think about eachother and why she speaks to me so and why ive started to voice my disapproval of her behavior ultimately the end of the phone talk ended with her venting as usual and ranting to me about her mom pestering her and having to go out with friends today she was late going to her friends so we could talk so i appreciated she valued trying to communicate but i feel there was no good true conclusion to our talk i think maybe im flustered and venting here now im not sure if this even makes sense to an outside perspective im stressed and worried for the relationship i dont want to treat her bad i love her but she also scares me with how she speaks to me and it scares me that she has a low value of me i dont want a relationship where my partner thinks low of me for no good reason and her inability to have a true serious heart to heart make me think she has mental instability issues im not sure how to handle her or if im to blame tldr im starting to verbally call out when my girlfriend starts to be disrespectful to me shes claiming im becoming overly sensitive but truth is i just let her slide all along and she exaggerates that now im accusing her of ruining the relationships all the time in just this isolated incident ive outlined im trying to understand if im to blame,0
im going to the hospital i hope its late im scared its hard to read my phone through these tears i cant handle this pain any more and i dont know where else to go i dont even know why im typing this i hope i take myself there and dont follow through with a different plan wherever this night takes me i hope i dont feel this way much longer,1

i survived its officially been a month august 16th 2018 worst day of my life so far im in junior high august 16th was results day for us i felt i did great in biology okayish in chemistry and pretty bad in physics after the finals turned out i flunked chem and physics and didnt do as well as i thought in biology i had a terrible feeling on the day all throughout morning as i was on vacation away from home at my relatives i would be getting a digital copy of my results through an email just about an hour or so before the times we were expected to recieve emails i made sure no one was watching me i grabbed my phone a rifle and some pellets i headed up to the terrace and hid somewhere i typed out my suicide note on my phone thanking everyone in my family and apologizing at the same time i loaded the rifle and waited time went on and suddenly i heard a buzz on my phone there it was i got a notification from the gmail app with my name on it i was hesitant to even open up the notification as my finger trembled to open up the pdf attached to the email i started sweating intensely filled with fear i managed to open it up my heart dropped i stopped crying as i was in abseloute shock i couldnt believe my eyes i had done much worse than expected i dropped my phone and aimed the gun towards my head whilst saying several prayers in my head i managed to bring my finger near the trigger i was again extremely hesitant to pull it just then i heard my mom coming up tbe stairs calling out my name as i had been gone for a while now i dropped the rifle and just stared at the ground long story short had a long talk with my parents basically i wanted to do medicine and they would immediately reject me as my grades wouldnt fit into thier requirements we all decided along with the principal that for me to get a higher chance at getting into a good university would be to repeat the year a lot of ppl in around the same position as me who also wanted to go for medicine are going into senior year but all have an obstacle as in some are doing another 4 course before med school and apply to medicine post graduate some have completely moved on to another job field meanwhile the majority are resitting individual exams at the end of the year plus exams from senior year which is super stressfull so in the long run i think what i went with is the best for me im stressing now because i feel isolated and alone as i lost all my friends however in 8 months time im not going to have to go crazy unlike quite a few life is life i learned my lesson ima fix all the shit up and move on thank you mom,1

sad story of my life sad story of my life tldr smile please this is not happy story hello everyone i would like to share with you an unpleasant story from my life maybe more from the last 10 years that will not have a happy ending i apologize for style but i am neither a writer nor english is not my native languagefor a very long time i thought to write my stories so that everyone could read it i didnt want to throw it on christmas or the new year to not disturb anyone this time the more so once again that i wanted to try to smile at the recipient of secret santa i didnt want to throw it in the vicinity of my birthday in the same way today when i have less and less strength and prospects for a better tomorrow i think its the last call for it forgive for long and boring introduction time to say something about me i am already a rather old man as much as 30 years old from a country in europe maybe some of you will infer from which for now living in the capital city a series of worse and worse misfortunes began perversely from the trip during which i said from now everything will be fine no worries if i knew how much thats words were stupid two days from these words i participated in a car accident which is interesting then i experienced my only fracture eye socket from stories i know that the surgery lasted for many hours and the exhausted doctor told my mother that life was saved well i spent two weeks in the hospital then a month at home where my only exit was a trip to the hospital on medical examination i dont recommend this condition and anabolics after which there are various strange dreams i survived i feel the effects to this day but it is not a tragedyafter the accident i came back to university i even got to the next ones but i did not start the same as i did not finish the first ones even though it only one exam left youll probably ask why well after the accident my relationship with one person important to me broke down but something else happened something no one expectedthe house that my greatgrandfather built in the 1950s in which my grandfather lived unfortunately died in 2012 through stress and these situation mother and i have been living since birth unfortunately due to the history and the very behavior of my country and the city our house for which we have always looked after weve done renovations we have brought water from a well or electricity has been given to alleged owners without our knowledge or any question in very unclear circumstances maybe even breaking the law but who cares we just got an enigmatic letter and so much silenceit was in 2011 and later we will come back to this due to lack of money i decided to take up fulltime jobs previously i worked while studying on weekends in college i could not focus even though i tried unfortunately i was alone without any support in 2012 i started working in a company as it seemed to me very good and where i would grow the more so because we cooperated for a giant in the industry and my contribution from the very beginning was continuous and required a huge amount of time what exactly happened at the time because i did not have to think about problems and that i worked 1214 hours a day or on weekends i worked and enjoyed it well but how could this idyll not last because it would be too beautiful after 3 years i was released from day to day on saturday night i came back from a business trip and on monday after working hours i got information end of workit is also like no tragedy right true if not a small detail from the beginning of 2015 they were receiving a payment for me previously there were only delays you know 510 days no problem i am a conciliatory man and im not brawlingunfortunately for 6 withdrawals i received only 2 and no money for overtimei asked i asked it did not do anything unfortunately i was forced to go to the orchard despite my reasons and the huge amount of evidence i was afraid and you know what rightly the case went on for a long time i am alone without a lawyer because as you know no money no lawyerthe result of the matter is absurd and negative my loss despite presenting a lot of evidence and challenging one only one proof of the other party which was my signature which does not look like mine at all and so the injured person became even more vulnerable because the system does not defend the weaker and i lost a large amount of money which i lose hope that i will recover lets go back to 2014 when the new owners of our house demanded money the amount is not small again of course neither courts nor authorities despite requests and presenting their reasons do not want to help because why help people like us the whole situation will probably end up landing on the street without money or other means of livelihooddear ones the above situations have meant that i have not been sleeping well for many years i also think that depression begins to get on me more and more because it would not be too colorful its not the only thing that touched mea few years back it turned out that my mother has sick kidneys even very stage 3 or 4 such irony because we have too easy in life mom is already years old and has to take great care of herself unfortunately constant stress is not easy and i cannot lie saying that everything will be fine because i see that it is notif you were wondering about one thing yes i work i earn unfortunately the amount is way too small and when i think that i will be without everything with unjust debts i think that this life does not make any sense even work because you know how to work only to give away everything evil and degrading perspective this is a damn bad and a downward perspective just as it was depressing that a person a woman whom i loved more than a life after more than 2 years decided that someone like me poor without money father no fact decided to add that ugly fat and stupid is completely nothing worth i loved her very much she knew it perfectly well she also thought of me but who knows since she lied to me on many issues because she liked her so much and wanted to be always the center of attention honestly when i was not alone i felt some support that gave me strength and now i have nothing and nobody after all those yearsits stupid to say but im afraid that if someone needed help id be the first to help so maybe she went right with my stupidity im afraid every day because everyone can bring something worse than the previous one i do not have the strength to look after others like i used to i will not give myself because i have neither strength nor strength you know the treatment costs tooi did not think that he would write something like that from his heart maybe a bit chaotic but how true at the end for those who have read all this i would like to apologize for taking their time but also to thank i also want it while it still lives and have any strength to say that if any of you have any problems need to talk to someone my inbox is open to you i have always been a good and empathic listener thanks to which i managed to help me somehow because if for me there is no rescue from these hopeless situations at least i will try to help you as well as you but also you i know what its like to be alone with everything when everything collapses i will try to listen and help all the best read the tldr at the top,0
272 days until i overdose and hopefully find something more story time fuckersim not depressed lol funny right let me paint a mental picture i am 24 years old im tall with straight brown hair and im white af i live in canada graduated highschool just barley and have accomplished well nothing but learning how to think as an individual im not like disabled or crazy or unhealthy i would say im just i guess different so i work at a convince store my first job i currently have stable housing situation rent is a little high but not at all unaffordable i am able to save and i have no debts i would say i am just a lost dude i have social barriers that i enact to keep people away obviously i do not have a love life and remain distant from intimate connections i have no friends or people im close with i do not have many issues but one of the big ones is never being able to be financially free to basically persue what i need and want i feel as if im slowly dying inside to the point that im just going to snap one day i cannot handle this never ending pointless work to just barely get a taste of what i could get if i work hard lol some will say im lazy and i am to a degree but this life burns me out everything is just so boring and primitive for me everyday i wake up dreading the experience i have to live through wich compared to lol a lot of things in this world is laughable for me some might think hey fucker you sound entitled maybe im looking for something more and there is just nothing but void for me i have tried a lot of things like meditation and hallucinating on dmt and mushrooms praying to godnow therapy normally i would be all over but i believe most if not all therapists are bias and there judgement is skewed on the best course of action for me as a person basically in conclusion i think i might be damaged goods so the best recourse for my person would be self termination in the most painless way possible heres hoping if you feel like it shoot me a message or comment it would be at least entertaining,1
eating meat well i just had the most unforgettable dinner of my life the meal included a dish of egg casserole a dish of fried vegetables and a dish of boiled vegetables i know how stupid it sounds to have 2 dishes of vegetables for a meal but whatever everything was going just fine until i finished my meal i could feel something stuck in my throat at first i thought it was a bit of the boiled vegetables i just had so tried to eat some rice some more vegetables lol and even a banana to help bring it down after all those attempts it even seemed worse that thing started poking at my throat i was just about to give up and forget about it when i looked at my throat in the mirror and guess what it was a fucking hair of a pig from the egg casserole cant believe i swallowed it without realising it needless to say i freaked out asked my family to confirm the nightmare and tried to get it by myself lol of course i couldnt and had to use the help of my mom the very thought of going to a doctor if we couldnt do it just scared the shit out of me luckily this is a he story so it didnt go any further dont wanna mention the process though to make everything worse i made the egg casserole tldr i had some egg casserole with a pigs hair swallowed it and had it stuck in my throat,0

really tired of women deciding that im not enough at the extreme risk of sounding like an incelnice guyneckbeardwhatever the fuck you want to call it im really really tired of being pushed aside by women i pursue im 22 attractive have a job outgoing and in my not so humble opinion interesting youd think that would be enough for just one person to try and make a relationship work with me but in two and a half years of being single all i ever hear is im not looking for a relationship or now is not the right time because xyz or i dont think of you that way ive tried talking to friends about it and all they ever seem to do is tell me everything that im doing wrong and everything wrong with me instead of actually maybe helping me find someone or giving me any constructive advice a while back i gave in and got a tinder account against my own personal wishes id rather meet someone irl and though ive gotten several matches over the months eventually even those women decide that it just wont work its really really easy to look at this scenario and say well the obvious answer is that its you youre the common denominator in these attempts at getting a relationship i realize that ive made great efforts to improve myself as a person but im at the point now where even some of my friends have no idea why im still single it just makes me feel like shit because nobody wants me and i just graduated college which means its now about 50x harder to meet anyone because im not constantly surrounded by hundreds of girls my age anymore im tired of being alone im not an incel im not a nice guy and im not a neckbeard im just a normal dude who has had abismal luck in the dating world,0

i just had my heart broken and i feel hopeless i was just dumped by my girlfriend the other night and i dont know what to do i cant really say im in love with you is what she said this just came out of nowhere and i feel like i cant breathe just a couple of days ago i thought we were still madly in love now im heartbroken and i feel like im going to have a nervous breakdown i just wish i knew what went wrong i wish she would tell me that i did something wrong tell me that i fucked up tell me i had abhorrent personality traits at least then i could make some sense of it but she just said that she changed and no longer felt the way she used to she likes me and cares about me but shes not in love with me anymore how am i supposed to react to that how can you say you love me on sunday then no longer be capable of loving me on friday she keeps insisting that i didnt do anything at all that she wanted to feel it but couldnt but how am i supposed to understand that im just hurt and confused she stopped by my house the other night to return some things i left in her apartment my shirt she had and it still smells like her and what really stings is that she returned the presents i gave her for valentines this year i dont know what im gonna do i spent all night crying i feel empty like my heart has been ripped out of my chest its like im trapped in a nightmare i cant wake up from whenever i was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away despite all the bullshit i deal with on a daily basis i always felt alright because i knew that no matter what happened i had her beside me and she made everything alright i honestly dont know how im gonna make it through winter without her our relationship was amazing weve been through so many good times and i was always there for her when she was going through rough times and she was there for me but when dumping me she was just so casual though like we had only been on three dates we were together for a year and she didnt even seem to react she said she doesnt see us having a future together i saw us potentially getting married one day i definitely saw a future with her and she used to see one with me i just dont know what changed i dont know how to deal with this without her i just feel dead inside just last week i was so happy now i dont know how im gonna live without her she was the best thing that ever happened to me now i feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces she said she doesnt think she was the right girl for me but we were perfect together i dont think i could ever find anyone else as amazing as her the only one i feel like i can turn to at this moment is my best friend they try to be sympathetic but theyre more of a tough love kind of person they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away right now but im a crying mess right now and i dont feel ready to try to date again but they are making me go back to online dating and i dont really feel strong enough to object right now ive never felt this hurt and empty i dont know how im supposed to make it through this,0
spin on my dick like a beyblade yuh,0
can someone please help me theres so many threads on here wow i apologize for the length of this post ill be so grateful for anyone who reads well essentially for my whole life ever since i was 13 everything has been on a downward spiral id always convince myself to keep trying id try to get good grades try to make friends but here i stand 6 years later no friends not a single one since 13 anyway i also struggled with my weight for a long time i managed to lose weight but by doing so i destroyed my body because i have excess skin so that didnt work out im never going to have sex which sucks i also have a spine condition that creates a hunchback and i have really bad acne scarring anyway the main trigger now is that i am currently in college just started and in one particular course my brother and i would work on assignments together however we recently discovered this was considered cheating and we are in big shit for it i have an exam for that course im not going to continue after this semester when i drop out im not sure what im going to do maybe ill just become homeless haha but i was sorta hoping to work up the courage to kill myself its so hard to do though i know my dad has a hunting rifle but idk how to load it i think ive decided on carbon monoxide poisoning as that seems like the best way to go anyway as of right now im pretty sure i wont do it quite yet but if i get kicked out of the course maybe i ruin everyones life this whole working together thing was my idea so i probably ruined his chance at college my dad and my step mom both hate me which is okay because i hate them as well due to being so lonely i resorted to making online friends and most of them ditched me which is fair but a few stuck around i make their lives worse though and im sure they just talk to me out of pity i really want someone to care about me as im a completely worthless human dont say im not worthless this is nothing new to me ive thought about this extensively and i have absolutely nothing to offer anyone or the world anyway i had to get this off my chest because of this school stuff happening now this could very well mean the end of my sad life which really sucks because i always told myself ever since 13 just stick it out itll get better youll lose weight make friends and be happy i dont want my life to end like this ugh haha sorry any advice from anyone who stuck around to read it id be very grateful,1

my friend 21m owed me money and when he refused to give it to me 21f my other friends gave him the money to give to me he pocketed the money over two months ago i booked an airbnb for my friends and i for spring break i put it on my card and all but one of my friends paid me back last minute he pulled out because he couldnt afford to go despite the fact that we cancelled our original reservation to accommodate him i had the foresight to know this would happen and so i was annoyed i was stuck paying his portion when we discussed it i told him i felt bad about him paying for a room he wouldnt be sleeping in so he could just pay me whatever he thought was fair fast forward to beginning of may he hadnt paid me back a cent honestly i dropped it i hate asking for money even if its for someone to pay me back however unexpectedly my laptop broke and it was gonna cost hundreds to fix it and i didnt have that money i reluctantly texted him asking him if he could pay me back not even all of it just some of it because i really needed it my classes started soon and i needed my laptop i felt bad for even asking and was very apologetic at first he said he forgot then he said you cant ask my boyfriends name to pay for it i said no and continued to be apologetic he said he couldnt pay me back all of it because he wouldnt be able to eat all week he means wont be able to eat out every day so he gave me 30 of what he actually owed me 40 of what i asked him he said he would give me the rest when he got paid the following week as you could guess he never gave me the rest its been weeks since my laptop has been broken and my mom eventually just gave me the money to pay for it i texted our other mutual friend who went on the trip about how i was annoyed she told me how she was with him when i asked for the money and that he was irrationally angry about it and asked her what she thought when she said she didnt think anything of it he got mad at her she said he made a big deal out of it and was upset he paid for a trip he didnt that he didnt get to go on and was complaining about it for a long time to both of our surprises she told me that she and our other friend who also went on the trip sent him the money to give to me because they thought they were saving a friendship instead of doing that he pocketed the money they gave to him to give to me she then realized he spent that money on juul pods im absolutely livid its not about the money to me i wouldnt have even asked for it had i not had an emergency its that he repeatedly said hed pay me back and didnt complained to my friend that he paid for a trip he didnt go on when he knew damn well that he was gonna bail before i even booked it but let me do it anyway gave me an attitude when i asked him to pay me back the money he owed me and claims hes broke but can spend hundreds to feed his nicotine addiction im just totally in shock that someone i considered to be my best friend would treat me like that im unsure what to do naturally i want to confront him but i dont want to throw my other friend under the bus letting it go is really not an option because i really dont know how i can even look at him the same way anymore what should i do next ask for the money back ask him to pay my friends back i dont care about it but i want him to know that i know what he did and how shitty it was tldr friend owed me money because he bailed out of a trip that i paid for last minute i didnt ask him to pay me back until months later when i needed it for an emergency he was rude about it talked shit behind my back about it and refused to pay me the full amount when our mutual friends gave him the rest of the money to give to me he kept it what should i do,0

i 20f am unbearably anxious over an unsure friendship w a former fwb 22m tldr should i remain friends with somebody who only treats me like an acquaintance now in short i was friends with benefits with someone i felt extremely close to he told me he didnt have any romantic feelings for me which i respected but i was still at his house almost every day im not sure how close he felt to me to be honest at any rate i told him i didnt like him in a humorous manner you know how you casually roast the friends that are close to you maybe not anyways i said something to that effect more than once apparently and because of that he said he didnt wanna have sex with me anymore but we could still be friends as usual immediately after however he pretty much stopped talking to me or hanging out with me as often he considers himself to be very selfreflective and emotionally mature so i approached him about it and he said hed just been busy we then planned a link in total weve probably gotten together 23 times in the almost 4 months since we stopped having sex i think in comparison to some other friends i have this isnt bad but in comparison to how often i used to talk to this guy its a bummer im still hung up on what happened at one point i questioned him at a thousand miles a minute about his motives and objectives about what transgressed he answered but im still not at peace i understand hes the victim here and somehow having sex with me made him feel used but the fact that he would interpret what i said so seriously after admitting to understanding it as a joke makes me disappointed in myself for what i did on one part and also him for having such an understanding of my person that out of all things a joke would be what ended it for him i dont care about the sex anymore but the whole situation has festered some animosity in me towards him though on the other hand i feel obligated to remain his friend to prove that i truly cared about him up until that point now im not so sure he has quite literally ignored my texts more than once where before we used to text throughout the day everyday and when we do talk in person he doesnt try harder than how are you it feels like were simply acquaintances i feel like i have to constantly pester him with questions for him to open up like a normal friend then he gets bothered by the questions and says that this is an inorganic way to develop a friendship the one time he dug deeper than how are you and asked me questions they were all about himself and my feelings towards him he asked me if i liked him romantically which ive discussed with him before when we were intimate i told him that i was a bit surprised he felt nothing for me romantically but that i liked him though i couldnt ascertain whether it was platonic or romantic i personally felt that the question and all of them in general could only benefit his ego and make me vulnerable it felt selfish and that his only curiosity about me had nothing to do with me myself the fact that his presence around me has changed so much makes me dislike him more otherwise im thinking this was always him and i was blinded by it since he gave me so much attention at one point he often comes off as pretentious and selfimportant im constantly anxious about where i stand with him every night i overanalyze what i originally said for him to cut off the benefits and when i decide that i should stop creating that anxiety for myself as hes answered all my questions i then move on to question our current relationship is it worth it to be friends am i only feeling this way projecting because of what happened would cutting him off just confirm his opinions of me what bothers me most is hes virtually emotionless he told me what i said made him feel bad but his explanation was a scholarly essay about the meaning of language and the philosophy of repeated phrases not actually but i mean to say his reasoning was more pseudoacademic than anything i asked him why even be friends if his philosophy determined that i really didnt like him and he said im mean and he didnt want to be close to me but engaging with me as a friend only is tolerable i understand if he feels that way but to try to be friends with someone who feels this way about me is hard and frankly im offended he said that he does consider me to be a good friend but words arent my love language more than anything whether i remain friends with him or not i really want this anxious feeling to go away any advice towards this would be much appreciated please help,0

using a squatty potty actually happened today my first experience with a squatty potty for those that dont know a squatty potty is a stepstoollike device that goes around your toilet enabling and lifting your feet and legs to be in an optimal position i myself had never had the luxury of trying one just an old fashioned shitter i guess so im staying with a friend and i see lo and behold that they have one so im like ok lets do this i sit down and begin to put my feet up in what im calling the shit stirrups and begin to do what comes naturally thats when the literal shitstorm happened to set the scene you must know something about me heres the tmi part last chance to escape before i say it my dick is a grower not a shower that means in flaccid form it is a tiny turtle head why am i telling you this because the angle my legs and hips were in with my feet on the squatty mixed with a small flaccid penis made my dick pop out of the toilet mid stream i am now pissing on myself and the floor in an adrenaline rush i try to stand up you know to stop pissing on my friends floor that action makes the step slide out from beneath me swinging my whole body backwards and i start shitting on the lip of the toilet seat at that point all i could do was finish spent 12 an hour cleaning the bathroom all while cussing out the squatty potty my life folks sometimes messy sometimes shitty always interesting tldr used squatty potty peed on self and floor slipped and shit everywhere,0

my experience with free therapy usa over age 45 for the middle aged readers i have posted here quite a bit recently some of my posts drew ire im unable to endure some of the things people here have endured long term thru their similar challenges some people who became homeless can endure living in a tent a shelter taking free handouts working low wage survival jobs with no dental or healthcare living with strangers after 3 years i can not im done not everyone can endure living that way for long periods of time at mid age some qualify for ssissdi medicaid i do not i have knowledge about the so called resources programs healthcare administration it requires extensive medical documentation acknowledgement of education occupational skill level evaluations with voc rehab doctors what got us here isnt for the same reasons but the system is designed to keep people enslaved dependent poor deprived of autonomy dignity some people who were raised in poor homes can adapt not everyone can this is what draws ire from those who have endured were not all the same i went to a nonprofit mental health center in 2018 and a free countystate paid mental health clinic to speak with a md psychiatrist this was due to job push outs at mid age combined with work place retaliation that wouldnt permit me time off as a new mid age employee to get corrective surgery many of the corporations where i wb whistleblew one employer that pushed me out of work donate to united way these nonprofits some of these nonprofits are shady all businesses exist to make money unlike private pay these places dont care if they help you or not most cant help they serve as places to vent you get what you pay for the md strongly suggested that i leave the area because i was in the south in a lower demographic from where i was raised the jobs the area were an obvious cultural mismatch i was encouraged to just pick up get employment and return to the expensive ne i agreed it does cost money to move i needed a job moving money and a place to live to rent i needed employment i never lived with random strangers selected from the internet i always had my own place when i moved south i had a job lined up and an apt with a commercial company that was well funded safe maintained my own lock key lease i couldnt get work up north i gave up my residence when i moved south i needed a job to qualify for a place to live i did an extensive search both in out of my career field my circumstances are complex i am financially literate low wage jobs cant hire me temp agencies cant hire me its not that its beneath me i would need someone to show me how i can survive and meet the basic necessities to live while making an extremely low amount of money i am s oriented adhere to a budget many places of employment said i am overqualified they didnt want to waste their time hiring a short term employee who would still be looking how do i know this i tried the survival jobs were low wage low skilled when they discovered i was still looking the micromanagemt nitpicking to get me to quit began to surface i wouldnt quit they had to push me out ive worked in profl co roles to understand human resources labor laws management healthcare costs cultural fit employer liability concerns cos do push out older people and they dont have to hire them either in the recent jobs i had the pay was inadequate did not meet my financial needs i developed age related health issues i couldnt afford housing healthcare on the very low pay i have to earn a living wage the govt cant take care of me the govt programs provide subsistence level care that is inadequate it doesnt meet everyones needs most therapy isnt even on the same cognitive level for someone with advanced education self awareness who had prior advanced therapy i was raised uppermiddle class where i had the best education and medical dental care i studied masters level psychology with my masters academic degree program i saw private pay out of pocket phd md therapists what kept me functioning was a healthy lifestyle combined with housing healthcare gym yoga dental vision care proper nutrition which costs money poverty living is hard on anyone men and women are not biologically equal younger people are not biologically equal to older people ive aged out of corporate jobs corporate jobs have been dumbed down due to automation the wages have been stagnant 401k pensions phased out with high turnover out sourcing lack of loyalty its not that i dont want to work i cant get work from my pushouts lawsuits the places need to be a cultural fit and pay a living wage my bills and obligations are not yours some people walk away from bills and they want others to do what they do ignoring bills lying on resumes shacking up with strangers isnt something that works for me i dont know how to dumb down function at a robotic sublevel i tried and the employers could see i was out of my element like what was i doing there what happened to get reduced to such a low level of existence i dont criticize others for their choices what i needed to stay alive thriving healthy is out of reach for me at my age theres 15 yrs max left to work ss minus medicare grad student loan will keep me where i am now and this is why i have reality based non mentally ill thoughts a need to s,1

glad i made ithey guys wanted to share this incase it helps anyone in november of 2015 i attempted suicide it didnt work not even close i thought it would and i was totally prepared to die when it didnt i felt a mixture of disappointment and relief cut to last october 2016 i was better definitely better but no where near close to being healed i was depressed most weeks and i often thought about suicide this lasted up until around the beginning of january until then i was still healing and still trying to just get through life cut to march 2017 id been feeling so much better i was enjoying life and for the first time in ages i was enjoying getting out and going to class and even seeing people thats why i didnt see that tuesday coming out of no where the feelings hit me and it was as if theyd never left i was on campus looking at everyone around me feeling completely alone and completely done i was determined to try again only this time i wouldnt mess up only this time my boyfriend saved me he talked me through it helped me through the night and by the next morning i was on my way to feeling better again you know how these things go finally cut to the end of march i decided to begin applying for jobs i graduate college in may i applied and got denied to many many places i was beginning to get distraught and i felt hopeless at this point i didnt know why i was alive it felt like i had nothing going for me and i was doomed to be worthless this process for me technically started in january but i focused a lot on it in march a week later a saw a job posting for a position that looked like it would fit me not thinking anything of it or expecting a reply i sent in my application the next day i got an interview that same day i was hired since then its only april today is april 22nd 2017 and i am so thankful i was never successful in ending my life this job that i thought nothing of has changed my life it is the job of my dreams each day i walk in to work so excited and so so incredibly happy after my first day the first thing i thought to myself was thank god i lived things can change things can turn around im not saying i still dont struggle or that i wont ever struggle again hell most nights are still hard haha but because i made it through i got to experience this incredible opportunity to work for my dream company doing what i love to do it only took 2 days for things to get dramatically better 2 days its unfortunate i suffered for so long and that most people have to but i just wanted to tell someone my story in case anyone else feels trapped in how their life is going i think ill always struggle but at least now im happy most days if anyone needs someone to talk to im here,1

found 28m my fiance27f posts in a womans forum i found out she much preferred sex with her friends with benefits and comments on pictures of naked guys been with my fiance for 2 years i proposed to her on thanksgiving we arent living together but plan to after getting married now before people get mad at me for snooping my girlfriend has read all of my reddit account posts and even my fb messenger history so yes i have seen my girlfriend use this website time to time when i got home i checked to see if she used her same username for the site and i saw her posts i was skimming over it and i saw she commented on pictures of naked guys and most of the time they didnt even have their faces on em one thing though is that it wasnt guys posting photos just women sharing them now ill be honest this made me really uncomfortable because reading those comments one she kept talking about how she wanted to suck these guys and give bjs in our relationship she rarely gives me a bj and in general she was a lot more sexual in these comments than she ever is with me i just never seen that side of her when she does get sexual its more like a thanks to me two all of these guys were a lot bigger than me i am closer to average after i saw that i already felt pretty bad but now i kept reading and then i find three huge posts and time to time comments referencing her ex and me there is one asking on how to find a girl for a threesome and if the girl should be prettier than her or less attractive she doesnt say its the ex but based on the time line i am pretty sure it is also she has never at all expressed interest in doing a threesome with me with another girl there is one about how to get a guy that is terrified of emotional commitment to settle down she says that he is super attractive and can have any girl he wants read the post and she basically talks about how despite all the stuff she has done for him he still isnt ready to settle down then a later post saying he was full of shit that he was just using her but she still loved him and then there was one with me written 280 days ago saying that she feels blessed that she found me in life she says that i keep her at an emotionally stable place she says that her ex wouldnt have made a good boyfriend because he is too much of a womanizer and that dating men that have that many women chasing them is only fun for short term relationships but she says that she really misses the sex she says in comments that i make her orgasm some of the times but its not the same i dont know what the hell to do i have dedicated my life to this girl i spent about a 1k just for valentines day only to find that she is only luke warm into me i cant imagine these thoughts and these feelings ever leaving my head yet at the same time i have planned out my life with her also things that didnt bother me in particular now really strings for example i used to think oh my girlfriend doesnt like giving blow jobs now i realize she doesnt like giving me blow jobs i dont know guys im fucking destroyed she has said this in the past and her posts show it too that of the guys she has been with i treat her the best yet she cares about me the least i dont know i feel hurt and broken i understand lots of people are gonna say but she is with you now and thats all that matters but i feel like the community college she is going to after being rejected by all of the schools she wanted to go to i dont know if im making too much of it if i should ignore those words because they are a private forum and i dont know the emotional state she was in i want to hear what she has to say but i have no idea if she can say anything that will ever make this whole situation okay tldr i found out from my fiances posts on a forum that she much preferred sex with her friends with benefits i also found out she comments on pictures of naked guys i am thinking of breaking up,0
im interested in a girl she seems interested in me but shes in a relationship that shes expressed displeasure about what do i m25 recently met a girl 24 who climbs at the same climbing gym as me and i think weve really hit it off i say i think because i was diagnosed with mild aspergers a year and a half ago which was a broadside hit to my confidence in my ability to read body language and social cues weve climbed 13 times a week for about 4 weeks now and as soon as we met i knew i had major feelings for her after the second time we climbed i found out through conversation that she has a boyfriend so i took the l and started the process of moving on we continued to meet up to climb and as we did so it kept resetting the process wed climb id get major feelings we wouldnt climb for a couple days id feel like i had moved on wed climb again repeat part of the reason it resets is because every time we climb im picking up on a vibe of extreme interest on her part giving each other light shit if we bail on a climb or otherwise screw up making a joke while the other is climbing that makes the other have to bail because theyre laughing jokingly pushing me or tapping my shoulder to emphasize a point offering to adjust my harness without me asking just because i said it was being a pain in the ass this past weekend she asked me to take pictures for social media as she climbed i sat down in a chair to review them with her and she stood behind me and leaned on my shoulder as she was reviewing them the reason i doubt these signals is because texting has pretty dry and basically just used to plan climbing days although one time after i told her id be gone for a few days on vacation she said how am i supposed to climb without my partner i know that some people are just naturally flirty and dont want to read into something any meaning that isnt there but i also dont want to be missing blindingly obvious signals about a week and half ago it came out that shes not happy with her relationship growing stale doesnt feel special etc i expressed sympathy for the situation and related it to a recent long term relationship of mine that had ended i didnt pry so as not to come across as eager about this situation we talked about it briefly and then continued to climb this past weekend we met up again and i asked her hows life and she said it sucks i asked why and she said considering breaking up with my boyfriend we then talked for about 510 minutes about the situation as she opened up about it part of this included her saying she didnt really care if the relationship ended note that this is the same day that she adjusted my harness of her own accord and leaned on my shoulder to review the pics now we come to what i need advice on i feel like ive been in a whirlwind for the past month and i just want it to stop i want clarity on the situation and dont know if i should ask tell her about the vibes ive been picking up on and ask if theres anything there but im willing to endure the whirlwind and sit on this feeling if its my best chance at making something happen with her down the line my dilemma is this ask whats up and risk losing a friend and climbing buddy because of residual awkwardness after the fact or wait and see what happens and possibly miss the train the last thing i want to do is interfere in a relationship but this feeling is getting to be a lot to handle so i repeat my question from the title what do,0

petty reasons for seeking attention outside of my 21f relationship warning youre about to read smth extremely stupid so my boyfriend 26 and i have been going out for about 3 months now all is well all is good or i thought hes going through a rough patch this period and although ive been trying to support him a couple of weeks ago we got into an argument he felt i was distant and uninterested like he was always supposed to entertain me and wanted to end it i was really drunk when he told me i started ugly crying we argued a little in my drunkness i went out clubbing alone god knows whatever i did horrible it was pretty dramatic but we sorted it out his birthday is coming up in a few days and i planned some activities for us he told me hed wished for a time to do bought him a birthday gift and was thinking of baking him a cake now i feel like i did too much we havent seen each other in a week which is not a big deal but im kind of disappointed in him not proposing something i also feel like im latching onto the conversation and hes seeing my messages but not responding i think that after the quasi fight we had im unsure of the whole situation and especially his feelings towards me im starting to believe i should quit its also worth mentioning that i always was the one who dumped the other one so this is was a huge shock for me causing me now to be a lil insecure he always commented on me responding to guys hitting on me im flirtatious by nature and even then was only making fun of the situation so as a consequence of me feeling left out and being the petty bitch i am i started to respond to messages guys sent me again thus gaining the attention i longed for i dont condone my behaviour in any way im not getting attention for a couple of days and im already knocking on other doors its not healthy im really upset i mean im nervous hes completely ignoring me and im not gonna double text him all the time goodbye this other guy invited me to a date tonight i initially wanted to accept although kindly declined thinking of the man who just last week confessed his feelings for me but hes not showing them im sad and other boys are waiting for a shot with me i only wany one tho i dont know if i should end our short relationship or wait for him wasting my time or his is not something i wish for maybe if our little argument did not happen i wouldnt be feeling this way tldr bf and i got into a fight almost broke up now i feel insecure and like hes ignoring me and acting single again like a dumb ho i need some sense beaten into me,0

how is it possible to move forward while i hate myself ish everything im told is contradicting everything i have ever experiencedthought incoming long post i just need to get this out of my head feel free to chime in please idfk i just need someone to tell me their opinion on this okay so this is going to sound like trolling but trust me it isnt every time i post something even close to this people always thing im trolling ive had a tough childhood im sure that affects this in a huge way i have lived with depression and social anxiety for 1114 years something very traumatic happened to me when i was in 3rd grade ever since that day i wasnt the same person when i was little i was outgoing fun just so full of energy i freakin loved playing pranks on my classmates lmao i was the class clown and it often got me in trouble after this event happened i just wanted to be in bed all day long i stopped caring about anything and everything everyone noticed but no one bothered to do anything about it those people who were supposed to protect me stood there and watched this go on and ignored it i shut down emotionally physically and mentally for several years until 8th grade when i tried to come out of my zombie state i couldnt lol i found out i had developed selective mutism i literally didnt talk to anyone at all i was isolated from society for so many years now heres where my problem comes in throughout all of this like i mentioned i shut down i really mean it i didnt shower for weeks at times no deodorant didnt brush my teeth i didnt take care of myself in general i didnt care about anything what im trying to say is i see myself as really unattractive over time i managed to not see myself as unattractive in my opinion im average not ugly not attractive theres just one problem with that though people constantly tell me otherwise lets get one thing clear before i continue i have never been one of those people that does around telling everyone how im shit im no good at anything im so fucking ugly i wish i were just dead im a burden so its not like people are telling me oh no youre not ugly youre hot because i say im ugly no i really mean it when i say i havent spoken a word in years my confidence level is nonexistent i have been told my actions dont back up the no confidence thing though i regularly in winter wear leather jackets i wear slim fit jeans motorcycle stand up straight etc stuff like that anyway so i regularly get compliments on my appearance theyre not like subtle compliments though on one occasion i was walking up the stairs on my college building and this girl and i almost ran into each other she looked up and said sorr and before she could finish saying it ohhhhh or not damn youre hot on multiple other occasions i have also been told similar things when i go to the gym i often find people staring at me im so puzzled by what the fuck theyre seeing or idfk because im like what the fuck im not talking about occasional glancing im taking about the creepy old guy type of staring im no where near that attractive theres a ton of more attractive people here wtf u looking here for a few hours ago today someone came up to me and youre hella hot um thanks i honestly do not feel anywhere near this attractive like i mentioned im average to me i honestly dont meet my own definition of attractive lol lets make a list of everything unattractive with me for most of my life ive had man boobs i still do somewhat have them but not as visible as before my skin is shit i have depression who the fuck has time to look like a zombie all day i have those lines under my eyes my lips are too big in my opinion i have a ton of medical conditions i have a lot more but those are the most prominent ones i guess honestly when im in the bathroom i cant even look at myself in the mirror idk its like people have too low standards compared to mine by the way like these standards i have are only for myself idk how that works,0

i cant take it anymore 15fi cant take it anymore but cant end it either not that im scared of death im scared that ill fail my parents mostly my mom cuz my dad rearly sees me abuse me mentally at least i think so maybe im just a fucking angsty teen whos ungrateful towards her parents but either way it fucking hurts bcuz my mom has a chronic illness she makes me and my twin brother chores i mean its not that big of a deal but like i have 9 classes everyday for 5 days extra classes i need some break too my twin brother has better grades than me and the equality my parents gives us makes my heart flutter sarcasm not long ago a mail sent to my mom about how i didnt attended a class and didnt done my homework which i did but turned in late and i even attended my class and after online classes ended my mom slammed my door open and yelled at me what the hell are you think youre doing why didnt you attend your class and didnt done your homework and i was panicking while trying to stay stable after my mom slammedy door again to my face saying think about what you have done im gonna talk with your father when he gets home and after she closed my door i had a panic attack and thought i should end it all rn so i texted my friends that i cant take it anymore and stuff but in the end didnt do it but when my mom gets an e mail that says your son did done his 4 or more not sure homeworks she didnt even get mad ahh yes ik im just the useless dumb one but you didnt bad to smear it to my face my mom gets angry at everything im sure that she tries to find things to get mad over so she can yell at me maybe like i said im just an ungrateful little bitch and my parents are right if my parents are really good people then my death will be like a holiday for them no angsty teen with her nagging no extra spending money no extra work either way my death would be better for everyone i know im not even sure that my friends even still like me i just annoy them but cuz im just a pitiful person they cant say that to my face i also showing some symptoms of ptsd but cuz my parents wont let me to see a psychiatrist i dont know i cant take doing the same things for everyday tame online classes fantasize about death sleep repeat i cant afford to get stressed about school every single day and i cant even understand anything the feeling of numbness us worse than being suicidal the void just grows and its just the worst not being able to feel and having a void inside you ive been cutting for a while and my plan is to go to the bathroom to take a shower and slit my wrists open in the bathtub but if i fail thatll make everything worse so if you have effective ways to do so please tell me i cant do this anymore and please dont tell me it gets better or dont do it i never thought that ill live past 20,1
i m26 dont know if i have started developing more and more feelings for this girl im dating f24 or is it just i want what i cant have been dating this girl for a couple of weeks and i really am beginning to like her shes not the type i go for either i usually always go for the blonde bimbo type girl with nothing much about her no idea why anyway the dates have been going well and shes showing signs that shes interested in me for example it caught me by surprise when we met up and i said hi and what not but she just stood there with her head up pouting looking for a kiss i was pleasantly surprised kind of felt like a girlfriend for a second which i have missed anyway she went really quiet with me after a couple of dates so i asked her whats wrong and she said shes not sure if shes ready to jump in and carry on dating i instantly thought shes letting me down easy i had that gut feeling we speak again recently after a few days of no contact and she said that she was comparing me to her me ex which shows shes not ready to continue dating with people i agree 100 thats defiantly a sign shes not ready but im not sure if shes just letting me down easy and shes just giving me an excuse shes split up with him about 34 months ago which is still fairly fresh imo shes knows id happily rather be told bluntly makes it easier so i go back into my tinder account and notice shes still actually on it which is fine were not exclusive or anything she can do what she wants not sure if shes using it currently but she has the same profile when we started talking because our conversation is still there point being is i think i really do like her i was gutted when she said she wanted to stop dating i dont love her or anything that serious but im finding it hard to distinguish either really liking someone and wanting to date them or having something i know i cant have is there a way to tell between these feelings its literally all i have been thinking about the last few days its actually affected my appetite dont really feel that hungry when i think about it as sad as it sounds tldr dont know if i have genuine feelings developing for this girl or is it one of those things where its something i cant have so i want it more even though i think we could still date in the future,0
unemployment and emotional numbness tldr i cant find a job postgraduation and its tricking me into thinking my wonderful relationship has something wrong with it because the love is buried under stress right now im f 21 a recent college graduate may 18 down on my luck for finding work and in the past week or two its become more and more affective to my self esteem and my hopes to find a job i really love things are really hard at home because my parents simply think im not trying hard enough even though ive applied to 70 positions since october 2018 the stress has numbed every single one of my emotions in the past week or two most unfortunately the incredible affection i typically feel toward my boyfriend 21 he is wonderful to me in every way and no aspect of our relationship has changed otherwise but i just feel this weird unexplainable distance from him and from my normal self too its probablydefinitely irrational but now on top of the employment problem theres a nagging worry that my relationship is somehow in jeopardy even though just a week ago and for the whole other entirety of our time together i knew he was the one and we still plan to be married im trying to remind myself that i must still love him just the same as always and care for him if im so worried about this i feel like the stress is playing mind games with me but everything is so hard to make sense of right now and im probably not in the right mind to make the correct sense of it anyhow has anyone dealt with anything like this is it normal im still young and totally new to fullyadult relationships ie not in school anymore so i feel like im still learning how to navigate these things in a way that is mature and not shortsighted will gladly accept any and all replies,0

i 23 f dont understand my friend 25 m this is my first time posting on reddit so here we go i first met my friend when he and his now also my friend were visiting from out of state i was coming back into town after a trip for further context we had met through tinder we started texting a lot and that soon turned into him inviting me to play games with him and his friend again now my friend this went on for quite a while constant communication and not to mention compliments it felt super flirty i very much started to develop a crush on him there was one point however he just kind of backed off his replies were short the way he was talking changed just things i noticed very easily through text i got very confused and disappointed i never said much about it though other than at one point i had asked if we were just friends he said something along the lines of yeah i thought thats what we were doing why after that time we didnt talk for a while couple of weeks probably a month or two actually then one day i decided to get a tattoo i had posted about it on my snapchat and thats when he started talking to me again and because of it we ended up planning on finally meeting he lives in the state right below mine and going there is only about 15hour drive so i did that next week i drove down there and met the both of them for the first time that was the start of the summer after that point we were back to talking again constantly the way which we talked was very cheesy cute and it was much more obvious than before that it was flirty we started facetiming all the time he would get off work and immediately ask me what i was doing and i would be waiting and expecting him i went to see him a couple more times i would stay over too we never did anything beyond just hanging out and then going to sleep cuddling he came up to see me as well so it wasnt like i was the only one going out of my way but then it got to the end of summer i went to see him on the 3rd of july to stay and do something on the 4th let me just say it was a mess i got pretty drunk on the 4th and was kind of a mess during that he kind of distanced himself and was hanging out with other people we had gotten together with i was left with our friend since he was the only other person i knew when we were going back home he asked if i was ok and i told him i was disappointed he was nowhere to be found he admitted to me that he hadnt expected me to get drunk and wasnt prepared to babysit me i was so embarrassed but we got home and i stayed and we just did our usual cuddle and then slept i went home the next day and again i noticed how he was talking to me and the frequency changed very short no initiation just completely off i panicked and was afraid i had just been a complete ass and scared him off thats when i confided in our friend and he admitted to me that he had told him he had hooked up with an ex he had three years of history with this was two days after the 4th i was devastated our friend had also told me that while we were all together he had noticed him talking to other girls still which could have been friends but i kind of doubt at this point for the most part i had the worst 2 months after that he and i didnt ever address it we barely spoke at all and then eventually i saw they were back together from an instagram post i just was so done i even went and got a tattoo to remind myself not to keep allowing myself to rely on other people for happiness i honestly felt so void the whole thing really fucked up my emotions but to no surprise in some time he out of nowhere drunk texted me and from there until about two weeks ago we kind of got close again ive been very guarded this time and didnt let myself sink in too far but i wont deny i still had and have a soft spot for him in that time i had also finally opened up and told him how i knew about everything about the hook up and that it hurt me because i liked him and thought he felt the same he admitted to fucking it up things kind of went back to us talking consistently and being flirty but after a month again i noticed a change again so i brought it up and he told me that he was thinking about it and that the distance sucked and he really values my friendship he would hate for something to happen between us that would ruin it forever we were just finally open about real shit and feelings and it was good but now were just back at the point where we arent really talking at all i know friends dont have to talk all the time but just the feeling of going 0100 is too much for me and i dont understand like sometimes i really dont know if he values our friendship like he says hes very hard to read and doesnt usually open up unless prompted idk i more or less just maybe want some input on this i guess since i have never been able to understand congrats if you made it this far tldr guy i liked from another state is slightly problematic and i cant read him or his intentions,0

while rehabbing a paid of my favorite shoes ive got a brown pair of leather desert boots that are my absolute favorite they were cheap but theyve held up incredibly well and theyre extremely comfortable seeing as they were cheap the adhesive holding the solon started to loosen and the soul started pulling away from the bottom of the shoe well i ordered some shoe goo off of amazon and spent the last three days gluing and clamping and regluing andre clamping and straightening and gluing some more be very careful to get them just right after letting the adhesive cure i was very satisfied with the results however the leather was a bit stressed from all of my efforts so i inserted some shoe forms into the shoe soak the leather nice and well and put them into my oven on the lowest temperature possible to try and reform the leather i fucked up and not realizing that this low heat would melt the adhesive holding the shoe together and when i pulled them out of the oven after 20 minutes the entire sole of the shoe peeled off the bottom and fell on the floor ruining three days worth of work oh well guess ill set about regluing them and reclamping them all over again hopefully the adhesive will hold i learned my relesson this time keep your shoes out of the oven tldr spent 3 days repairing my shoes only to sabotage my own efforts by melting the sole off on the oven,0
my birthday was yesterday and only acquaintances from years ago remembered i got a notification from facebook last december saying that no friends wished me a happy birthday last year didnt think much of it since i had a great time celebrating it with my family and i wasnt that close with my course batchmates yet i was a little disappointed that my friends of 7 years forgot though i always celebrated their birthdays with them after all yesterday i was surprised that an old friend group that i havent interacted properly in months greeted me not a single greeting came from my friends of 7 years and my newly befriended batchmates whom i had gotten really close to it was weird seeing how friends ive only known for a few months cared to remember than the friends ive been with for years on a happier note i celebrated my 20th with my boyfriend he was more excited than i was greeting me every minute and being super affectionate like a hyperactive puppy id never had a happier birthday,0

apparently i posted a vaguely suicidal rant on twitter shortly before attempting and failing i have no memory of this the answer to the question is drugs i was unbelievably drugged up in an attempt to make sure i wasnt sober enough to follow through with what i wanted to do apparently i attempted with a bag because thats what i woke up with on my face i still believe if i hadnt taken the drugs that i wouldve succeeded that night i used to have a twitter account when i was in college almost a decade ago and once i graduated i stopped using it i started burning bridges with most people and started detaching as much as possible well i nuked the bridge with those tweets i didnt know what was going on until i opened my phone and the twitter app was open this immediately caught me off guard because i havent had the app on my phone in years first thing i see is just a screenshot of my suicidal rant on twitter with the caption someone wants attention i dont really know how to describe the 17 tweets i posted but it was so spiteful hateful self pitying it was just unbelievable that i accidentally shared this awful side of me with hundreds of people i quickly deleted the tweets and deactivated the account but not before seeing people subtweeting about me and replying to the person who posted the screenshot there was a rather large thread of people i havent seen in years just saying im not serious mocking me for how incoherent my tweets were pulling out quotes and making fun of them and taking digs at my mental state there were even a few people who made veiled statements saying they wish i would kill myself the 17 tweets themselves actually had zero interaction not one like not one comment but there were at least 20 instances i saw of people posting screenshots and quotes and that just means there are more out there who i dont follow or who are privateblocked i expected going silent wouldve made people worried but nope nobody texted or called nobody called the cops nothing and is it bad that it just made me feel worse that nobody actually reached out to see if i was okay the last thing i wanted was attention it wasnt a suicidal gesture like i saw people saying it was but seeing nobody care except to be mean was really difficult im glad no one called the cops but seeing how people reacted just absolutely crushed me seeing so many people callously talk about me and openly mock me was just awful i dont plan on making any statements online or to anyone who followed the account i cant believe this is real i dont do drugs i dont drink i dont know what its like to black out like this and not remember doing something im not any more or less suicidal im still just trying to commit to not dying before 2020 i cant tell you how much this affirms everything ive been feeling i used to just think they all hated me now i know,1

have you seen targets new remodeled stores whats your opinion on them hello peeps have you guysgals seen targets new remodeled stores if so whats your opinion on the new look of the store we have one where i live and its been under renovations for a few months now its starting to look majorly different and ive been subscribed to rtarget for a while so ive gotten to see the finished remodeled stores you could search on google for remodeled target stores if you havent seen em my opinion on the remodeling is that it looks really nice and all not to mention fancy af but in my opinion its too fancy for the market target is in target is more of a walmart type of store that sells everything from bathroom things all the way to foodvegetables i feel like for a store to be this fancy it would probably make more sense to be kind of a fashion store such as clothes stores idk just my opinion really curious to see what people think about the remodeling whats your opinion on all of this,0

ive had a thing for my close friend for a year and it only seems to get stronger met him in university we were living on the same floor in our dorm building and had similar classes because we were in the same program but we never actually ever hungout in class if we saw each other wed smile but thats it so we saw each other at the same time each day due to schedules just aligning we always said hi sometimes a little conversation here and there but always smiled or said hey i loved it he made me feel so at ease and comfortable he is a little socially awkward but its actually endearing i feel like its something that makes people like him so much if you get me anyway long story short we just started becoming better friends during exam season last year literally december 2019 and then got really close during the 2nd semester started jan 2020 until the pandemic really hit and everyone was in lockdown midmarch we stayed in touch of course but spending lots of time with each other at the beginning of the year confirmed my feelings for him and i knew it was real because when i told our mutual friends about my crush i started to like him even more we have gotten closer with our 2nd year being online sept 2020 and while we did talk in the summer it was only a few times a month cause he was so busy working and all when school started we would talk to each other at least 6 days a week so we grew closer with each discord call lmao and stayed there for hours we had periods where we didnt talk for like 20 minutes but having that person on the other side was very comforting i imagine for both of us as he literally told me that if we couldnt discord everyday he would kill himself lmao online sciool had made us say things we never thought were in us its been shitty man but omg i want him so much i know we wouldnt actually work out long term because we have different core values and want different things at the end of the day but right now i want him so bad i know our friendship isnt worth sacrificing so i know it probably wont happen but i cant ever stop imagining him holding me when i feel sad and upset or him doing other things to me you know what im talking about i know i want him because literally every time i get high i think about how much i want him and ive been getting high a lot recently because im on christmas break and this is something i need after the pain of those last 3 months anyway i just wanted to share that would love to see anyones thoughts or opinions on this esp after i sober up,0

living situation with bf hey guys my boyfriend and i have been at a crossroads lately we love each other but arent as close as we used to be we are in the process of reconstructing a currently non habitable house to call home one day my bf was living with me at my parents but didnt want to over stay his welcome and moved into his grandparents until the house is done it has been six months since he moved out and we have been having a hard time seeing each other the house has 6 months to a year of work to be done in the meantime i want to rent an apartment to live together in i think it will either help us to reconnect and get away from the stress of living with family or realize that we arent meant for one another i suggested that i pay for all apt bills and his money can be used on our future house he is against my proposition and finds it is a waste of money he wants me to move into his grandparents with him i cannot do that considering his sister and so live there and it is a very small home wondering what your thoughts are and if you have any suggestions for me to communicate with him on this issue thanks,0

opinions on this group from a former radical feminist ive been perusing these threads today and im actually in a way relieved i should state im a millennial woman who has been exposed to the radical feminism of my day and used to adhere to those views myself i still absolutely want equality between the sexes i dont want anyone to be exposed to violence injustice or unfair treatment of any kind men or women i think both sides can seem off the rail and deranged to the other which leads to more violence and injustice yesterday i would have believed that most men were innately violent and unreasonable as the uncontrollable monsters you are often painted to be in radicalized feminist circles shallow unkind lacking empathy depraved etc i think its important that everyone from both sides listen to the other but its incredibly difficult when emotions are involved we all want a moral just society its honestly refreshing to hear from this side in that you all dont want to be seen as rapistsviolent offendersetc not because youre hiding something and want to discount honest women in pain but because its unfair men undoubtedly have their own issues unique to them and they deserve societal attention as much as womens issues as shocking as it seems were all connected and our issues intertwined as well i think women who believe that fellow women are always angels and can do no wrong and that men are the true enemies are seriously deluded i think unkindness hostility and hatred are the true enemies regardless of who it comes from personally ive had far more abusive relationships at the hands and words of my fellow females than from men except for my narcissistic brother and a few dumbass bullies in high school but still ive encountered more unkindness from females than males in my life no sex has the moral highground and its a relief because honestly i was really starting to live in fear of men perpetrating random acts of violence against me at any moment its great to see human beings as actual human beings you know sure there are psychos out there and i may be more sensitive because of my abuse but it doesnt mean every man i come across is a depraved psychopath its dehumanizing hopefully others will start to find a peaceful way of living too its exhausting to always assume the worst in other people if i have more questions id like to start discussions to gain more understanding anyway those are my two cents thanks for reading,0

please read my post and help me make my dads 90th birthday present special and with any luck it will help make your day a little special too this post is long but i hope if you take the time to read this story you might find yourself inspired to step out of your comfort zone and do something that scares you or better yet if you have ever suffered from depression or felt overwhelmed by life maybe just maybe there is a nugget or two of truth in here that helps you and sorry there is no tldr i think the heart of this story is worth a few minutes of reading effort if you dont have that time to give i surely understand skip to the end and watch the video and leave birthday wishes if you arent interested in the backstory my father is an amazing man and is directly responsible for all that i have been able to accomplish in my life he turns 90 on march 8th and i wanted to do something special to celebrate his life the story that follows is the life adventure i have been on to accomplish that task hopefully you will be moved by the story and will help make this a special gift for my father at the end of this post seven years ago when my oldest son was 16 he had a little garage band now i have no idea where he got his musical talent but that boy just started playing guitar keyboards drums pretty much anything we built him a music room in the bonus room above the garage and he and his band would play all day and night on the weekends those were really good times now i dont have a musical bone in my body ive never played an instrument and about my only experience with music had been singing in the shower and in the car when commuting to work but my sons excitement about music inspired me and i began writing lyrics while i was driving to work each day i would give him the lyrics and he and his little band would turn them into songs it was fun interesting and a great bonding experience about that time i wrote lyrics about my fathers life those lyrics just sat on my phone for a year or two then in 2014 my father was turning 85 and the family planned a big surprise party for him i decided maybe there was something that could be done with those lyrics if i could just find some musically inclined good samaritan to help turn them into a song my son was off to college by now and didnt really have the interest or time to help so i turned to reddit first i began posting around on various subreddits to see if someone would volunteer i was relatively new to reddit and really didnt know the ropes very well and had trouble getting any post traction i remember bemoaning the fact that i couldnt find anyone to help and someone started a subreddit in that thread called rmakemysong i quickly posted the lyrics there to see if someone would bite heres that original post which shares a bit about the trials and challenges my father has faced and overcome in his life url well a few people threw up quick shots at a song but i didnt get anything that resembled a viable song nor did i get an offers for a collaborator to help me so there the idea died or so i thought flash forward to present day my fathers 90th birthday is fast approaching and with more reddit wisdom i thought why not try again this time i researched musicbased subreddits and decided to post a plea for help writing a song on rsongwriters you will see that the post link in a second below got literally 3 upvotes and that was all this little diy project needed to get off the ground uelbow_or_gtfo showed up and threw his hat in the ring now i had imagined that it would be a similar process to what i had done with my son all those years ago i would hand my lyrics to uelbow_or_gtfo and he would unleash his artistic ability and drop out some amazing song that i would be able to give to my dad but this adventure became much more involved so much more personal exciting scary and eventually satisfying read through that post thread here and youll see what i mean url so im a guy that knows exactly nothing about music and yet ive somehow written and sung a song about my dads life by far the scariest thing i have ever done and yet one of the most fulfilling as the scale of this adventure expanded so did the ideas and work my oldest son agreed to record the guitar track for the song i reached out to all of my siblings and nieces and nephews to have them sing the closing chorus and we decided to create a video to go along with the song that would use old photographs the few we had from my fathers youth along with many many pictures of my siblings and the 12 grandchildren to tell the story of my dads life along with the music and now we are closing in on the end of the adventure ive uploaded the completed music video to youtube my dads birthday is this friday so we only have a day or two to wrap things up do you want to help me finish this project if so could you please go to the video link below and leave a comment in the youtube comments section wishing my dad a happy 90th birthday and maybe mention where you are from i am hopeful we can get 100 birthday wishes for him from all over the world in closing i want to say this was the scariest thing i have ever done in life i cant think of anything more petrifying than taking your personal thoughts and words helping to turn them into a song and then actually singing the damn thing for everyone and their brother to hear and make fun of but you know what never let your fear of failure your fear of the unknown stop you from trying something new and just as importantly hopefully those of you that are currently facing lifes challenges will hear in my fathers story some truths that can help you work through your current situation as well peace heres ode to billy url please share the link on social media if you can to help get him more birthday wishes,0

what should i do about a conflicted ex long post so this whole thing has been weighing pretty heavy on me recently and its been a big part of my life for a few years its this girl of course im 19 m she is 20 we started having a relationship almost two years ago at this point and it started out wonderful she turned out to be my first real girlfriend and we both fell head over heals hard we both have a lot of issues to ourselves but im the type of guy who likes to work through problems and try and come out the other side better she is a free spirit who doest know what she wants in life but shes got a ton of energy and loves to do or relationship started to get a bit rockey and she ended up breaking up with me fast forward a month or so and she wants to get back together because she realized she made a mistake and we ended up getting back together after that she broke up with me a few more times claiming she needed to fix herself before she could come back to our relationship what happened was that our relationship became toxic for a few different reasons and she wanted to get out of it and so did it i consider myself an empath someone who feels emotion more has a heavier effect on me aka someone is in a bad mood i can end up actually absorbing that energy and be in a bad mood myself so many of the times she would be unhappy our poor communication would lead to me picking up on her negative energy and mainly the poor communication would intensify the problem im not blaming her for the negative energy i didnt help the situation most of the time but i always wanted to work through it and love her weve been broken up since about june this past year after breaking up and getting back together almost every month since the first time we broke up and i guess i broke the cycle this last time she came to me over the summer after breaking up with me she felt like she wasnt able to be the best her for the relationship and this one upset me because i told her i was scared to get back with her again because i thought she might randomly breakup again and then she did so over the summer she goes to a music festival and tries to get ahold of me to fix things and my frustration and anger took control and i basically told her off for breaking my heart then she gets into a relationship with a guy she met there then fast forward to september i dont know what got into me but feeling of being betrayed for months and heartbroken changed and i decided to get ahold of her to see how she was and to apologize for all of my negativity which is one of my flaws ive been working on for my whole life and im still working on i think she is a part of that process i almost think that if i can make things right with her that i can solve my other frustrations if that makes any sense so i apologize and she starts telling me how her relationship hasnt been going amazingly and that she has been waiting for me to get back to her and that she basically misses me of course this is good news to me because i want to be with her and love her and shes showing that to me as well so we jokingly set up a date she is gong to come visit me which happened to be the next day and she comes through we went on a date had some great laughs and whatnot and then she comes back to my dorm where you can guess what happened i thought i was in heaven lol she still hasnt found anyone that she likes better in bed same for me which is sorta important and then she leaves the next day and says ill get back to you on if we are going to be a thing after that she went back to her boyfriend and decided to stay even though she said they werent matching well so i get super emotional because that really fucking sucked no anger working on it lol and she basically stopped texting me as her answer of who she picked should be over it right get over her get a new gf move on ect and thats what i did i found a girl who i found interesting and that went well for a few months that girl and i ran into our own problems different to this other girl and is but i ended up breaking things off with her but before we broke up she cheated i texted girl 1 out of curiosity theres just something about this girl and i dont get it theres no logical reason i can justify our relationship because of what happened between us the goods were unreal and the bad was really shitty for both of us but here i am still feeling for her but anyways i started texting her again to kinda find out if she made the right decision and after a few days of taking on and off she told me that shes super depressed with this guy and is getting frustrated with him im holding on to the little faith i have left and he doesnt get my jokes and it chips at my faith are some quotes from her so the new girl and i break up and i continue to talk to the first girl as christmas time starts rolling around after christmas weve talked to each other every single day sometimes the convo turns into talking about sex because we both miss it with each other other times its talking about dreams that the other person is in sometimes its her complaining about her bf after we started talking about sex more and more i finally asked her what we are doing she says she doesnt know and that it makes her happy to talk to me and that her bf knows and hes okay with it only because it makes her happy so i ask should we really be talking shes admitted that i learned her as a lover and not a friend so i feel that its wrong for her to have a bf and still talk to me wrong because the dude is sorta being cheated on and also wrong because i also want to be with her but im not able to her response was i need to think about this and the next day we continued to talk like normal fast forward a week or two and were still having convos about hot dreams and sex in general and its like i fall in love more each day even though maybe i shouldnt and she still hasnt given me an answer but this whole thing has been on my mind 24 7 for weeks and its driving me up a wall last night i told her we need to talk about it even through text cause its hard to get ahold of her so i started telling her everything on my mind about wanting to be with her and asking her why shes taking to both of us and i said this i know you dont know what you want to do but at somepoint you have to make a decision because it effects me too sometimes you gotta make hard choices and you cant avoid making one here no matter which way you go you know why im messaging you and what decision ive made at this point i need your response to which she replied i need some time to think about this tldr fall in love with a one of a kind chick toxic relationship and on and off dating for 6 or so months after first breakup she gets a new mans who she chooses over me and then tells me it might be a mistake but she still hasnt decided and flirts with me even though shes still in a relationship should i be doing this is it worth it am i in the wrong what should i do im going insane and i need your guys help,0

forgetting social decorum at my wedding this happened on saturday and im still cringing i got married to my lovely wife over the weekend i was pretty overwhelmed when she came down the aisle in her dress and she looked so amazing and beautiful we did the whole hug the parents and get up in front of the officiant thing and once we were up there i just took a minute to appreciate how good she looked she was wearing a really sexy dress that was tight down almost to her knees her backside looked great and i gave it a little squeeze she jerked away from me and looked at me with so much disbelief and then i realized what i had done we had our backs to everyone and they all just saw me grope my wife the groomsmen and bridesmaids were cracking up my in laws and my mother looked horrified im surprised my wife didnt leave me right then and there we managed to mostly pretend it didnt happen and move on with the wedding but once we got to the honeymoon suite my wife wouldnt let me consulate the marriage until she could express that i am a dumbass but its okay all is forgiven and maybe shell laugh about it in 5 years maybe tldr i grabbed my wifes ass in front of everyone we know,0

im a dodgeball face magnet whenever i played dodgeball in pe at a kickback or an event i always got hit in the face no i didnt get hit by some little throw it was given by that athletic kid with their big arm and its strong powerful throw more than half the time they were aiming at someone else so i never even expected it another thing i wore glasses so they always got knocked off just to make the scene even more embarrassing and this happened i repeat this happened every single time i played dodgeball after about my 20th game over the years i just chose to sit out immediately i was so done with getting hit in the face with a dodgeball no matter where i was what time of day if i was playing a game of dodgeball i was gonna get hit in the face if i recall correctly i still got hit a few times while i was sitting out you dont have to read this paragraph its just a specific example i apologize in advance for this being so long i once went to a youth group thing in middle school with one of my friends who had invited me a group of kids were playing dodgeball indoors and we decided to sit in the back of the room against the wall away from it all then of course out of nowhere the ball came flying at me and bam right in the face again by this time i was used to it but i hadnt realized that they were playing with a volleyball i just laid back against the wall casually acting like nothing had happened after my friend asked if i was okay then my nose started bleeding like crazy so a leader that happened to be there rushed me to the bathroom and helped me clean it up now i think to myself those days were in the past tonight i went to a kickback with my friends and guess what we played dodgeball i was a little afraid at the thought of playing it but i chose to anyways for the first three rounds i was doing fineby that i mean facewise if that makes any sense but if you were speaking on terms of winningwell i was always one of the first people to get out on the last round i had been out for a while so i was sitting on the floor the rule in this game was if the dodgeball touched you you had to sit where you got out this one guy who was still in had the dodgeball and was aiming to throw it at someone on my left so i think hey im sitting down theyre up above me im fine but hooo boy was i wrong the dodgeball was really light so it didnt travel very far when he threw it with full force sooo yep it hit me in the face he said hey pause the game pause the game then ran over to me saying how sorry he was asking if i was ok etc definitely the most genuine apology ive received from someone who had thrown a dodgeball at me overall the situation itself wasnt very bad but my face still stung and it was red from the pain mixed with embarrassment the reason i wanted to share this is bc it just annoys me like ik its something minor wtf why do you care about some dodgeball games yada yada i get it this shouldnt matter its just a small thing that frustrates me from time to time my question is even when i avoid playing or im not in how do i still manage to get slammed in the face with a dodgeball do i have some magical talent that allows this to happen every time i almost want to say its not even funny but i mean cmonmy dodgeball problem is strange enough to make me laugh a little,0

i fell hard for a fuckboy tldr i fell for a guy that told me he wanted to have fun and be single but would get drunk and completely contradict everything he said i have been single for over a year now i was lonely and wanted to meet someone to date went out with a few friends but no one really caught my attention and i didnt seem to catch anyones attention either so i decided to try okcupid met a few guys but nothing really clicked i am a gemini i love to make jokes and have a good time one day i swiped right on this really cute guy lets call him jr he responded and we talked religiously through instagram snapchat and texted after about 3 days we scheduled to meet up at a bar its been wayyyy too long since i met someone i find really attractive and also enjoy talking to he really got my humor he wasnt disrespectful through our conversation and he didnt bring up any sexual topic so i was feeling pretty good about it all we took a few shots and moved to a different bar i asked the big question to him what are you looking for he responded with i am not looking for anything but if it happens it happens right now i am enjoying my single life after the bar we went to the top of a parking garage we went outside and just surveyed the town with his arm wrapped around my waist it felt really good to be touched again without much thought we had sex in his car that night it was amazing sexy and passionate something i havent had in awhile that night he texted me if i made it home safe i didnt respond till the next day and our conversation went well to the point he asked to see me again but this time to meet his friends to me that was a huge success he did not msg me until a few days later asking to hang out again this time i brought my best girl friend and he brought his boys my best friend acted as my eyes and ears to see if he was interested in me or just playing games with me i was a bit tipsy and to avoid showing him how i really felt i talked more to his friends and decided to give him less of my attention my friend said it seemed like he was enjoying my hard to get act he tried all night to talk to me and each time i was sassy and just played it off cool my friend even told me that night all he asked and talked about was me he asked my friend if i was seeing anyone what i like and dont like it felt very obvious to me and my friend that he took high interest in me i was so fucking happy finally at the end of the night i gave in and we had amazing sex again i was torn between will just be hook up buddies or morph into an actual relationship i didnt want to rush anything so i decided to wait a little more before asking any more questions next friday he took me and my friend out for clubbing prior to that was talked non stop through snapchat he was friendly asking me about my day and it was nice i booked a hotel room so i dont have to drive back home which is an hour away from the club this time he also brought his female friends as it turns out he had met them all through dating apps and one of the 3 girls he brought in was getting his undivided attention he tried to talk to me but i was jealous i couldnt help it so i played harder to get i was embarrassed to ever think that we might have had something it felt too late to back out so i let it go and partied but my pride was hurt so i called another guy i met on the app and brought him to the club it irritated jr but he did nothing i was on my way home with that guy when jr called to check up on me that confused me more after that night our conversation died down he treated me more like a good friend than a love interest i didnt want to ruin my chances even more so i acted as a friend that next weekend we went out to party again and i invited another guy i didnt want jr to think i didnt have options but this time he was surprisingly more attentive toward me he wasnt flirting with any other girls i really liked it a lot at this point i wanted to univite the guy but he was already on his way eventually the guy i invited came and he was really nice and handsome maybe even a better option for me than jr he gave me the undivided attention that i wanted and was compassionate and relaxed unfortunately i was already emotionally attached to jr we partied and i tried to be polite to the guy i invited while still giving jr the majority of my attention eventually jr got tired and we all left to go back to the hotel we were staying at on the way jr told me i am done with girls it was a huge lost today he didnt specify why but i believe it was because most of the girls he talked to through the apps just end up with different partner in the end and not with him he asked me who was the new guy i brought and when i told him the whole truth to why i even invited him in the first place he sound disappointed but what really changed the whole game is when he said i think youre really beautiful i love you as a friend and if you ever need help in the future i will always be here but i only see you as a friend i was so confused if i was just a friend why be so attentive towards me it was just me jr my best friend and the guy i invited staying in the hotel room my best friend was hammered so we put her to bed and i stayed up to chat with the guys it got really deep jr opened up about his last relationship how it didnt work out and how alot of people think he is a player now but in reality he just feels insecure and talking to more girls gives him confidence but as jr got more drunk he started saying things like i really like you youre so unique someone will definitely like you for you one day i was a little drunk too and we ended up kind of having sex in the hotel bathroom after all this happened i expressed to him over snapchat that i really do like him and i was okay with him not feeling the same way he response was youre catching feelings too quick i think youre an amazing person but tbh i met alot of ppl but i just dont feel like ive met that person i am willing to settle down with were only young once and might as well enjoy it while we can ppl lie and all that shit no girls will fool me i dont care what anyone says until the time comes i just want to enjoy my single life a week later he posted pictures of him flying to another state to meet up with a girl hed been talking to for about a year she was extremely pretty and i was really envious that for someone who is a huge playboy he was willing to fly all the way to another state to spend time with her maybe it was just the sex that gave me this emotional attachment but i know for one thing being with him made me feel really happy even if it was just a one month fling ive never forget all the roller coaster feelings i had with him deep down i wish some miracle occur and he would turn back to feel the same way about me but i know the reality and i guess i just have to live with it,0

close friend wants to be gone from this world soon my close friend has suicidal tendencies whenever she and her girlfriend fight two weeks ago she sent me a picture of her slashing her wrist a bit below the pulse i immediately alerted her family mother and grandmother they found her locked in the bathroom conscious and she was okay for that night but now she and her younger siblings are far away from their home a plane ride away earlier this night she told me things arent going well with her girlfriend theyre in a long distance relationship but she thought that person doesnt love her anymore for some reason that she doesnt want to tell me their communication went cold she kept saying that her only solution is to kill herself she sent me a goodbye told me that shell be gone by tomorrow morning its already 2 am here the only person who could stop her is communication from her girlfriend because of their quarrels shes thinking that her girlfriend doesnt love her anymore i went to message her girlfriend of the situation to please reply to my friend to fix their relationship and to stop her taking her life i did the best i could calling her sisters the moment she thought of suicide two days ago i told them to keep all sharp objects toxic chemicals blades keep them locked and away from her reach to prepare to call for help in an emergency told them to talk to her remind her that her family appreciates her i feel so helpless being miles away from her side im doing as much as i can to do what she wants i feel the burden i want to save her life i let her know that i love her i care for her i appreciate her being hi i just want to let you know that you are worthy and that you are appreciated by someone just keep living please remember that your family loves you your friends love you i love and care for you is what i told her but she kept refusing to look at life because so all i need is her tldr a girl that i love had issues with her girlfriend she told me shes committing suicide when an opportunity comes shes far away from me i alerted her sisters but for how long can we prevent this im doing my best to reach out to her but she doesnt want to listen to me what else can i do to save her life,1

im not sure if i should tell my friend how i feel so i had a snap streak with this guy lets call him j for almost a year but we only started talking at the end of last summer a few days before the school year weve been friends since we dont talk much at school or in person but we text and snapchat pretty often so j asked me to prom about a month ago and i said yes prom happened last weekend and i think we had a good time the after party on the other hand thats a different story this was the first big party i went to and i dont drink very often so i didnt know my limits i had quite a bit to drink and i was totally wasted to the point where i couldnt walk straight or keep my head up i like j a lot so naturally being drunk i kinda made it obvious i told him he was the cutest guy at prom and i asked him if he liked me to which he replied youre alright because i couldnt hold myself up i was hugging him and holding his hand we were basically cuddling most of the time lmao he was caressing me but i dont know if that means anything fast forward to the next day we talked on snap for a bit and things seemed okay between us but as the week progressed it just became weird i felt like j was avoiding me or that he hated me but i didnt ask him about it because i didnt wanna make things even more awkward people were asking us if we were a thing and someone posted a sarcastic comment on my instagram picture of j and i at prom implying that we were more than friends i thought that might have pissed him off so i felt like he was distancing himself from me so today weve been talking all day and this morning we cleared the air he told me he was irritated that he wasnt able to enjoy the after party because i got so drunk but he said that he wasnt mad or irritated at me just at the situation and hes not mad that i got drunk he just didnt wanna feel obligated to take care of me which i guess i understand it would be annoying if you had to stay with your friend the whole night cause they got hammered i kinda felt like he didnt care about me when he said that but he could have just ditched me and handed me over to my best friend but he didnt do that so i guess that says something im not sure i confronted j about being cold to me this week and he said he just felt awkward because he didnt know where we stood after the party i guess cause we were cuddling and shit and he isnt good at handling situations like that im still trying to figure out what this all means but i dont think he likes me and i dont think he ever will that might be my insecurity of no one will love me talking so thats why im posting this because i wanna get a fresh perspective on this situation i think j and i are pretty good friends and he means a lot to me so i dont wanna ruin what we have by telling him that i like him in the event he doesnt feel the same way and things just get awkward and we stop talking i tried to make this as short as possible by leaving out any irrelevant information but it still seems pretty long oops,0

shutting downi honestly tried to write a deep story of my life and why im so fucked in the head like 3x but whats the point i cant recall the last time i was genuinely happy and i dont think ill get the feeling ever again i tried to commit suicide before and failed mostly due to being nervous and being on impulse ive tried the whole hold on to life itll get better thing and its been 9 years and im almost 25 and guess what it hasnt still unemployed still degreeless basically homeless sleeping at random homes of the junkie acquaintances ive made ive come to terms with the fact that ill never have a loving wife and kids ive come to terms with leaving the small amount of people if any thatll mourn my death behind im tired of this feeling of being alone of never being loved of being worthless knowing that when i breathe my last breath absolutely no one would give a single fuck i honestly envy people who dont have to deal with waking up in the morning crying because theyre still alive even though greater people than me have died while im here wasting away it fucking sucks id gladly trade my life in a heartbeat for someone more worthy but it doesnt work that way its selfish of me to take my life that was given to me by my parents but i didnt ask to be born looking back my only regret is not doing it right the first time to save me from becoming even more empty than i am now i do however have the perfect playlist final meal and spot in which ill take my life where i can stare at the beautiful night sky floating away while the drugs and alcohol finally take toll on me it may sound scary or stupid or whatever but fully planning it out and not on a whim like the last time makes me feel super calm and ready to end this fucking suffering,1

i just got out of surgery i got what was thought to be either an oil sac or hair sac from my right thigh close to my weenier but it turns out it was a muscle or a small piece that was basically a muscle it used to be small and it irritated me and it hurt whenever i moved my leg but then was given medicine and it was supposed to disappear but it only got bigger but it stopped hurting when it became bigger 5 months into the whole situation i got the surgery done just now it was the first one i had done that didnt require to put me to sleep so i was awake during the whole thing but luckily it didnt hurt much i felt little burns close to the end of the operation which i assume it was them stitching it and cauterizing the place they took it out and said it wasnt and oil or hair sac but another muscle i dont know how it became bigger or what caused it to appear but the doctors didnt know why hair or oil sacs even appear so i assume the are oblivious to how this muscle appeared out of nowhere currently it kind of burns even when i dont move my right leg but im fine with it i hope that the burning feeling isnt gonna stay during this whole day but im limping because it kind of hurts and i cant take painkillers because i take take all kinds of other medications so it isnt good for me to take them heres a picture of that muscleurl nsfw please dont click on it if your squeamish its a little out of focus since my mom took the picture but if you dont want to look at something like that then please dont click on it anyway thank you und goodbye i love you,0

how do you tell the difference between friendly and flirty so ive known this girl for a long time and weve been pretty good friends for a while now shes easily the best looking girl i know and ive told her that multiple times shes really touchy with me a lot and when we were in the car the other day she started playing with my hair from the backseat and pinched me on the neck it was a pretty hard pinch actually and said let me give you a hickey and she just started laughing its so hard for me to tell because none of my other friends who are girls do that stuff with me i always keep eye contact with her for a long time too and i always found that funny because im a pretty shy person shes sooo cute and sometimes i just wanna go in for the kiss but everytime i back out of it but when all that stuff happened the other night it really made me think what do you guys think has this kind of stuff happened to you before i just need some advice,0
new years always makes me a lil sad not sure why i usually spend new years with good friends having a good time celebrating and all that jazz but around this time of year theres a real general awareness of the passing of time that doesnt exist in other parts of the hear this like hypercognizance makes me feel very aware of the meta were living in ya know especially new years eve when were counting hours minutes seconds i always become very aware of my personal human experience like im here breathing right now in this moment on this day living the one life i have to live and i gotta make it count even when ive head good years like this year i got a new job with better pay doing something i really like and working with people that i love in an awesome community its just always a question of but am i doing it right i see people kiss each other i currently am not in a relationship and never really have been which ive been wanting lately as i get older i see people getting new jobs in places like new york or chicago and obviously making more than me but those people were finance majors which would have made me throw myself off a cliff and money isnt super important tbh among other things and i just think am i doing it right is this sufficient am i making the most of this momenttimeyear i dont have any other chances i always try to do my best and generally feel okay about it but new years time always makes me doubt i kind of wish we didnt celebrate it it would take the anxiety away i usually enjoy myself regardless but the worry paints the celebration with a veneer of doubt anyone else feel anything similar how do you deal withapproach it thanks for listening,0

by accidentally telling my girlfriends dad about our stoned sex plans during a trip to visit him my girlfriend sandy for this purpose and i live hundreds of miles away and we get to see each other every so often long distance is hard but when you find someone as kind loving and gorgeous as she is you make it work its lovely time when we do connect and we always look forward to it for the obvious reasons spending time with each other eating yummy food and sex a fantastic activity absolutely worth trying in a few weeks i am hoping on a plane to meet her and spend 10 days on the road driving around to go meet various members of her family including her father carl for now a kind man in his late fifties whom ive met just once before for an ice cream cone without his daughter around thats a story for another time anyhow weve chatted a few times since in a family group chat that i was graciously added into a month or so back my comments lean towards the impress the family and dont say anything dumb tone and so far i dont think ive blown it back to this trip being more a of a shoot from the hip kinda guy i benefit from having a partner that plans things out down to the very last detail this trip is no exception with weeks to spare she sends me a rather thorough itinerary via google docs it has my arrival times the restaurants well visit the wake up times to catch sunrises on the road and so on being the responsible young man that i am i make a few choice edits including post arrival sex for a few hours and super high sex for a few hours immediately following the scheduled trip to a dispensary and finally sex and snuggles before dreamland she sees these comments and laughs before editing things out and calling me childish fair enough tonight im sitting with my newborn niece appreciating the end of a hard days work and admiring the pure ness of a child with my phone across the room on silent i stroll over to take a peak and there are a handful of texts no worries lets take a look one from a buddy one from sandy and a handful from the group chat with sandy carl and her brother shes telling them about the trip and for convenience she sent them our itinerary via google doc its been a few minutes since sending but just to be safe i open that bad boy up to see whats planned apparently post arrival sex for a few hours and super high sex for a few hours are still on the agenda and carl and her brother are very much in the know fanfuckintactic only time will tell how this trip goes but if initial responses are any indication we should be just fine and you dont have to broadcast you sex schedule it takes the romance out of it making it a duty consider it a given like morning pancakes carl sandys dad tldr my girlfriend sent her dad and brother an upcoming trip itinerary that included private details like stoned sex,0

dealing with loss hypothetical situation youre one of those people who never really liked being alive but you muddled through because you didnt have the heart to inflict the alternative on your family one day through dumb luck you meet someone if you were the kind of asshole who believed in true love you might think this was it they make you happy they make it worth waking up in the morning you can see a future with them not just that but for the first time in what feels like your entire life you can see a future where youre actually happy and not just slogging through life wishing something would finally kill you they feel the same way you both want that same little cottage and theres no real reason you cant have it one day they need to run some errands you get a terrible feeling about it and ask them not to to just stay home with you they dont listen they tell you its just a quick train ride that theyll be back soon that they love you and that youre kind of always with them turns out you were right not long after they get off the train theyre struck by lightning theyre dead by the time they hit the ground if you had a soul to sell to bring them back you would you cant bring them back and nothing you can do no amount of money magic or anything else will change that now what how do you keep going why do you keep going i have no fucking idea and i really wish i did,1

i am strongly convinced that my muay thai instructor committed suicide yesterday i probably cannot think about killing myself again i have trained with my private lesson instructor from 8th grade to 12th on a consistent basis then had some lessons during recesses during my freshman year of college i was going to schedule private lessons this summer but then my father stumbled across the post on fb from the bjj academy the caption had a quote about weakness and the internal and external someone left a comment saying that they were sorry that they could not help i am convinced that my instructor took his own life he was a stepfather husband trainer coach and champion and he is now deceased one of the other guys who trains under him made an instagram post with a caption you will always be in my corner and this is what hurt me the most some of you may not see it now but if you were to commit suicide you would destroy a lot of people my father and i were not extremely close with my trainer despite how often we went to training most of the chat was about ufc but he was not that interested in me besides that however it brings the two of us great sadness given how monumental he was in bringing me past my limits and how he has destroyed those around him suicide should not be an option i have underwent a lot of depression and i have been mentally hospitalized and attempted suicide before i am not stranger to misery but i will never think about selfharm again now cannot say for you guys that things will get better i do not know your situation and i would hate to bring false hope but you matter somehow always remember that,1

i just took a blast to my past on a kpop forum i was so fucking annoying holy how did i have friends on there jesus christ im crying though i met some really chill people there including this one girl though at the time she was an entity to me with no gender and it was a weird hate love relationship no romantic feelings lol mightve just been my hormones and she was like 21 at the time and i was like 15 and thats so surprising considering the maturity difference but omg we would joke around and id drag her faves through the ground then there was this tumblr page that got made and people called me annoying on there and i got hella depressed because i had no life in real life and that place was my only source of happiness looking back im not surprised at the amount of haters lmao oh its just all very nostalgic and i want to cry i logged in anonymously to see my old posts and inbox but most of them were deleted and the ones that werent were recent and were not during my peak celebrity phase on there im only kind of sad i lost all my friends i made there since i left since im not comfortable being friends with people when im not happy,0

i 22f dont feel like my boyfriend 26m is attracted to me is it in my head heres the backstory i come from an emotionally abusive home and have had one past relationship with an abusive ex i am very insecure and always have been however i met this guy about 4 months ago and its the first time ive felt genuinely comfortable with a guy including casual flings etc we started off very casual but ended up growing feelings for each other and establishing a serious and exclusive relationship things have been tricky because of my past issues in my current life as well as his etc but we support and help each other through it hes the first guy ive had feelings for who hasnt belittled me etc honestly i thought our sex life was great we had sex once or twice every time we saw each other i gave him head all the time which he loves i know he is a tad bit shy plus i am his first relationship since he was in high school so i know hes learning how to be expressive in a relationship i know this because i asked him on his birthday when we were getting at it its your birthday what do you want and he looked a little embarrassed and just said you haha and it took him a few moments before he asked if he could cum in my mouth and i was like of course then over text he brought it up saying he liked it he would often only discuss things he liked the night before over text and in kind of a shy manner i thought it was sweet and knew he was getting closer to opening up so i was giving him time and letting him know that i want to know what he likes so i can make him happy it took him months to admit he had always wanted to eat me out and finally do it so theres that so in my feelings of comfort i playfully brought up the idea of a threesome with another girl its a fantasy of mine he was all for it but said i dont wanna mess things up with usare you sure i told him yes but its just an idea for now and we could actively pursue it in a few months maybe he agreed we dont sext too often because we see each other quite a lot but i was out of town and we began sexting and it was really hot then we starting discussing the threesome and he went into detail about what he wanted it surprised me but again it was hot and i was into it howeverin the past few weeks things seem different to me he also went on a trip and each night i wanted a video of him cumming i love it but for him to get there hed bring up the threesome and one of the girls i had specifically showed him from tinder different girls on different days i generally show him all my matches to get his opinion he also said that for the girl he preferred blondes with blue eyes like me as for the body he said a big ass thats not huge and big boobs over tiny ones wellfor my size i have an ass i definitely had an ass when i was ten pounds heavier but he met me after i lost weight im really tiny due to my anxiety and some health problems and for my size im not flat by any means im a 30c which is like a 34a but on a smaller frame i would categorize my breasts as tiny and i wouldnt call my ass big so basically he prefers my opposite i did bring that up saying i didnt want to attack him for his preference but i was now curious if he really did like my body seeing as im so petite he said he did but sometimes he doesnt cum when we have sex like last night and then he went soft i know he was tired and sweaty but he lost interest sometimes he gets tired and i finish him off ill send him texts telling him how hot he is how much i want him and he kind of responds okay and sometimes not at all i cleaned his house for him and he texted a thank you and i said anything for you to which he said anything i said yes with more sexual emojis and he said watch the game with me that felt great i just said sure he said he only said that to surprise me i said i wasnt surprised i sent him a meme about being in a relationship with someone who is too hot for you and said how i feel about you and he just said lol is that why you cant sleep the meme was people laying in bed awake at night also felt great now im not feeling comfortable enough for the threesome although its still a huge fantasy of mine he doesnt bring it up much honestly but he did ask if i was still gonna hang out with this tinder girl i said i wanted to chill with them first and get to know them i said maybe and he went on about exactly how he wants to fuck us both and want he wants to do to us still its hot so i was into it and all but tried steering the conversation more towards just us saying oh by the way when i give you head next i want to try this he said it was a good idea but kept on with the threesome thing he said he anticipates cumming like 3 times but last nighthe didnt cum once he had said it was super hot upstairs last night temperature wise and he was sweating so i said haha maybe if we keep the ac on you can go for that long and he said if i get frequent head i can definitely go that long im still over here like you didnt cum once last night is it me physically is it him or am i just over thinking cause i feel like he just wants to fuck other people and cant even be that excited for me tldr summaries are hard,0

having trouble getting over a relationship they lied about things but i still love them like a family member throwaway account because people know my main one im having a real hard time getting over a relationship with someone i built a bond with to preface they have issues they are getting help with we met online 2 and a half months ago and i fell in love with them i gave them money because they needed help and bought them stuff to keep them happy with anxiety and depression after awhile they found someone and i didnt know the truth behind things until recently they lied about things and i dont blame them for what they did theyre young and have mental health issues i moved on when they found someone else and eventually found someone myself but we created a bond i cant say i didnt get jealous for a bit and kinda made them mad but i wasnt meaning to do the stuff i did i apologized and i know i have problems too we both went too far on things they learned their lesson and are getting help medication and therapy i learned too they helped me and i helped them and i love them like a family member i know they feel bad about what theyve done but i dont blame them for anything i understand they have issues they want to start fresh and by doing so leave me and im crushed they dont want to talk to me i just want to be a friend i dont want to be a constant reminder of what they did i never wanted to be the one who caused them problems i also at least got them help the way they were going something was gonna happen anyway i hope they can put it in the past and we can talk again one day i feel like i lost a lover family member and friend i just worry about them and i love them i kinda just want to die help me edit i guess here im just gonna say it because age and gender has to be included sure they wont see this anywayso for more context were both male they said they were 18 and strung me along through this to get things that would calm their anxiety a bit worked for awhilei guess in the end they had to be honest that they were 16 i dont blame them like i said sooooooooo much pain tldr met someone online talked for a bit fell in love with them they met someone and we both moved on from that part but wanted to stay friends they actually lied about their age and felt bad about it and finally told me they left me to worry about them because i still love them like a brother they have anxiety depression and other issues and are getting help i just cant not worry,0

absolute abundance in dating abundance mentality is something thats frequently prescribed as an answer to mens neediness issues approach anxiety having a weird or awkward vibe escalation hesitation failure to invite women home anything where a guy comes off as hesitant or is nervous about achieving a certain outcome men who know there are women everywhere and know they can get women whenever they want goes the thinking wont worry about it but in fact a standard abundance mentality will only get you halfway there this articles going to focus on what i call absolute abundance something that goes beyond ordinary abundance first though lets have a look at what an abundance mentality is and how you can work to develop one abundance mentality abundance mentality is the name given to the feeling the belief that a man has abundant options with women that there are attractive women everywhere and that he can get them with relative ease once a man achieves an abundance mentality seduction seems like a vastly easier prospect and far less work of course getting there is easier said than done id say it took me a good three years from the time i really began training seriously in the social arts until i reached a true abundance mentality for me the realization came when i took women home three nights in a row on vacation and i saw that i had reached a point where any night i put enough effort in i could take women home it was reinforced further that year when i worked on street pickup and found i could reliably bring women home most nights i went out just from meeting girls on the street once i reached that point all my old beliefs about women being difficult and challenging to get and about seduction being this tough skill i still had to master fell away and suddenly getting girls seemed like a game i had mastered after three years of hard work and sporadic results it became straightforward and i achieved consistency but abundance mentality is not achieved in an instant rather its built up to over time as you develop more skill in seduction and things become clearer and easier to control and the fog that hangs over this area of most mens lives fades the better you become at seduction and the more you understand it the more of an abundance mentality you naturally develop its also developed through experience if youve only ever dated a few women women will feel like scarce resources that are hard to come by but if youve dated many and if there are always women in your life they seem like far more abundant resources you dont worry so much about them theyre just there if i was to recommend a process for developing abundance mentality i think that process would look like this absorb information on understanding women and social dynamics a lot of men who dive into the social arts work on learning routines pickup lines and various things like that all those things are short term fixes theyre bandaids for a lack of understanding about why things happen the way they do in social contexts and why women are the way they are the more you understand women and socializing the easier a time youll have figuring out confusing or novel situations and the faster and more consistently youll start getting results with women practice practice practice the number one key to developing an abundance mentality is getting results and the number one key to getting results is getting out there and meeting women lots of women not a few a week a lot of them you really need to be serious and meet lots of girls and push to move things forward if you want to get to a point where youre consistently finding success with women and build a real sense of abundance move somewhere with abundance built in if youre living in the country and there are ten beautiful available women in your entire town you will never ever develop an abundance mentality i promise at the very least move to a city with a lot of beautiful young women if youre more ambitious move to a city in a country with a lot of beautiful young women compare osaka japan or florence italy or so i hear buenos aires argentina with any city in the united states my home country and what will you find vastlymore women who are thin and attractive by comparison and an average body size that is much less likely to tip the scales if youre used to going to the club in the states and seeing three or four girls who arentoverweight youll be truly amazed stepping into a nightclub in a major city abroad and seeing it filled with beautiful thin women everywhere instant abundance get ambitious are you inviting women homeurl regularly if not you likely have no real idea what women would go home with you given the opportunity and what women require more work i just brought a girl home with me a few hours ago who was trying to go back to her own home because she said she had a lot of work to do before she went to class tonight but i invited her back with me and she came abundance is heavily influenced by how many women youre bringing home and how easy you think it is to get them home if youre not trying you might be surprised how easy it is to get a girl alone with you thats abundance mentality getting there is no piece of cake but its certainly achievable once you get there though youve only made it halfway because on the other side of abundance mentality we have an entirely different beast absolute abundance whats absolute abundance its something i became aware of last year as a oncewonderful longterm relationship of mine wound down i knew logically i should let my girlfriend go it had passed the point of no return but i wrestled with the decision shes such an amazing girl i thought i dont know if i can ever find anyone as incredible as her id roll through the list of her qualities in my mind and decide i didnt think i could i realized in retrospect that despite my feeling of abundance in general i was lacking a feeling of abundance in another way i lacked the feeling that i could find amazing women easily sure i could go out and pick up a girl to spend a night with but if i wanted to find another beautiful intelligent dynamic ambitious successful professional woman with a high degree of inbuilt loyalty and affection and devotion could i before i met maybe two or three women who met those very specific qualifications a year that meant two or three chances a year to get myself a girl id be willing to invest the time and effort into building and maintaining a longterm relationship with yikes better not blow it when those chances appear and thats exactly how most guys feel about women in general its another shade of scarcity mentality its scarcity of a particular type of woman in this case the kind of caliber woman i look to have a longterm relationship with i lacked absolute abundance but i soon developed it perhaps nine or ten months after id developed ordinary abundance which is something i find interesting i see guys whove had abundance mentalities for years and still get quite hung up on the rare girls they meet they deem of high quality theyve had abundance for years but still havent developed absolute abundance why is this i think the reason why is that most men who teach themselves to meet women focus solely on the meeting part and arent choosy about the kind of women they maintain relationships with they tend to turn girls they arent crazy about into friendswithbenefits and then sometimes fall into relationships with those girls their standards for women theyll sleep with and women theyll date arent all that different im a little different i dont do the friendwithbenefits thing anymore because i dont see any longterm value to it if i just want intimacy i can spend time with my girlfriend or i can go out and meet a new girl it doesnt make much sense to me to keep seeing a girl im not crazy about this is similar to how i am with friends i have a lot of friends but mostly only spend time with the friends i find pretty amazing theres a learning curve with this kind of thing it meant that for a while i didnt have a lot of friends because it took me a while to figure out how to meet amazing people how to spot amazing people and how to bring them into my life in the meantime i was spending a lot of time with only one or two friends or by myself similarly with women it takes you a while to learn how to spot amazing women how to meet them and how to bring them into your life once you have it down however youre set its just like meeting women in general get the skill and youre on easy street once you know you can consistently meet the kind of women you consider amazing whether thats the kind of women i mentioned above that i consider amazing or whether its different kinds of women altogether you will have achieved absolute abundance heres what i think the keys are to absolute abundance as far as i can tell abundance mentality without abundance mentality absolute abundance is out of the question work on standard abundance first and worry about this later known standards know exactly what youre looking for you have to know what it is you want before you figure out how to find it consistently so if you like brownhaired women with a fiery disposition or you like blondes with big breasts and glasses or you like latinas who wear suits to work know that what kind of looks do you look for smarts education career upbringing and background wealth or property personality independence devotion or loyalty how passionate must she be do you want a woman who seeks novelty and is a thrill seeker or one whos quieter and more conservative you must figure all these things out before really getting a clear idea of what you want putting yourself in the position to meet the women you want if you want women who like to relax and kick back and maybe go surfing and light bonfires london or new york city probably arent the places you want to be living conversely if you want women who are ambitious successful and upwardly mobile those cities are excellent choices in addition to actual locale you can look at where youre meeting women women in loud dance clubs are going to be more likely to lean one way women in upscale lounges another women in dive bars still another and women in salsa bars another yet women who spend their weekend days at the coffee shop vs the bookstore vs the beach vs the park are all going to be different kinds of girls look at where youre meeting the women you are and ask yourself if youre going to the right places connectionbased courtship a lot of guys i know and am friends with are party guys specializing in party girls which is lots of fun for sure i made it a point to learn how to consistently get party girls but for relationships party girls arent what i want and in my experience they arent what the majority of men want relationships with either yet the higher quality women tend to be pretty adept at screening out party guys which means that a lot of men whove specialized in getting party girls often arent able to reliably get higher quality women the way around this is connectionbased courting and socializing of women when you get good at connectionbased courtship you can very quickly find out a great deal of information about a woman and get her feeling extremely connected to you in a hurry this is what most higher quality women respond to higher quality women are accustomed to being approached and courted constantly by all kinds of men and they mercilessly screen out the party guys whom they can tell arent really interested in them as people high quality women will still have fun but usually with safer men or men they can control when it comes to dating they want men they feel know them well and understand them and make them feel very connected and cared for because they know they can get that and they expect it lifeimprovement and development of social class and grace the higher you go in quality of women the tougher at screening those women get they aggressively screen out men who party too much men who lack ambition men who lack class and social grace and a host of other factors like all people high quality women are searching for men they can relate to men who are as ambitious and successful and driven as they are you dont have to have your act perfectly together im by no means financially well off with an uncertain future and no promising job prospects at the moment on any continent but im dating a beautiful confident girl with a pornstar body a conservative upbringing a highly prestigious professional job who is in the process of getting her mba and she buys me food and brings me gifts nearly every time i see her despite my shaky situation though she sees that im an intelligent guy whos got drive and ambition and wants to do something with his future whatever that might be and i treat her well and make her feel things no other man ever has and i do it all with class my current girlfriend says that she rejected men for a year after she broke it off with her fiancee a year ago but she liked me because i was a gentleman and she still considers me a gentleman despite originally getting very upset and embarrassed by how quickly i bedded her indeed my last girlfriend said something similar she would always reject men who approached her but i seemed different and a good friend of mine in california an attractive successful professional woman would typically only date more refined professional men with the odd suave seducer thrown in for good measure all these girls are very high quality very attractive women and they all routinely reject the loud crazy party guys the classier the woman the more class and ambition she expects from the men she dates id say i realized id reached absolute abundance when i got to the point that finding amazing women no longer seemed like a challenging prospect meet enough super cute girls and some of them are bound to be amazing that and and this ones the kicker knowing youve got what it takes to hold onto those amazing women are what grant absolute abundance knowing you can meet them consistently and knowing you know how to keep them once youve found them thats absolute abundance not all men will tell you they want successful high class high society women with good breeding and education and who take great care of their man and are devoted a cute party girl is enough for me a guy might say you know what i say thats settling its like the guy whos had three shortlived girlfriends his entire life who says im not going to bother studying seduction because i do just fine with women he doesnt want to go through the painful process of learning and growing and challenging himself so he settles i challenge you to strive for not just abundance but absolute abundance i challenge you to make yourself into a classy driven suave man that high quality women desire do well with party girls for sure but also position yourself to find success with the best women out there only then will you feel truly incontrol of your dating life and have the comfort and the contentedness that comes from knowing that you have an abundance of the worlds most amazing women chase amante,0

f25 got out of a long term 5 year relationship m25 and just confused about it all ill start off by saying im not necessarily upset moreso just confused i was with my first and only boyfriend from ages 2025 im currently 25 i experienced all my firsts with him sex and experimenting moving in together getting pets together etc weve always had a sort of rocky relationship full of mistrust and not handling things properly in retrospect i think its because we were both so young dealing with our own issues and figuring out what we wanted in life over the last couple of years there were defining moments filled with toxic aspects on both ends however i felt like his were more extreme i was dealing with insecurity and jealousy issues whereas he was dealing with his temperanger anyways over the summer i found out he had done things like pay for tinder premium and he couldnt pay me rent in over 6months and went to a strip club by himself when i was on a work trip i ended the relationship and asked him to move out at the beginning of october i had told our mutual friends that we both met while in college what had happened but ill preface and say over the years these college friends were more my friends than his because he never made any effort to hang out or talk with them after i kicked him out he wanted to stay friends which ended up leading me to let him move back in then he announced he was going to take a private guard at a military base in another country overseas so he quit his job in december and lived with me until he left march 1 he didnt have a job and had sold his car so he was dependent on me and was severely addicted to weed and i could even say he was low key addicted to porn anyways last week he told me he just wants to be friends and not date i was fine with because i think mentally i never fully came back into the relationship and hes in another country anyways but then last night he texted me out of nowhere basically saying ive blocked you on everything i dont want to be your friend i cannot be friends with someone i hold content and resentment towards and someone who has turned my friends against me im sorry for being a shitty pothead and i wish you well and it was so strange this came out of nowhere im not sad or anything im just curious as where this is coming from i hate leaving things on bad terms he still owes me quite a bit of money and i really hope even with everything hell pay me back any advice is appreciated im just trying to process it all there is a lot i left of but this is a small gist of it tldr no longer with the person i spent 5 years with just trying to cope,0

deciding to live feeling the desire to live and how i did it and no this aint no sales pitch bitch this is my life this is just informational if you check youll see or maybe youve already listened to me lament into long posts about my neuro disease or my deeply broken heart soul crushing loneliness and despair well i had started receiving ketamine infusions this past october and they worked but the boosters well they werent quite doing the job obviously then i learned that dextromethorphan the ingredient in cough medicines with a dm signification is a nmda antagonist with the same mechanism of action as ketamine google the crap out of that this is why street drug users no judgment drink bottles of it theres a subreddit for that btw but let me be clear i was not interested in that i was interested in using it properly treat depression and my neuro condition which included crps which ketamine is also used to treat so after discussing it with my pain doc an anesthesiologist she said to try it so i did at first it made me woozy and i think it may have given me diarrhea for several days it make me talk in my sleep and have extremely bizarre dreams but i knew it was working after some dosage tweaking i wound up taking 6mg 1ml every 6 hours for a total of 24mg a day thats a pediatric dose btw that can be given to a child twice a day i take the delsym 12hr extended release but i didnt like the up and down that i could definitely feel so i took it in smaller doses 4x a day and after the first week and the dose adjustments all the weird stuff went away completely and the results are amazing i feel happy not a suicidal thought in my mind im not sad or despairing when i think of what used to hurt deep in my bones it still feels sad i get a twinge in my stomach but im able to gently turn those thoughts off where as before i couldnt stop them i still feel im not numb i dont feel drugged i just feel normal and content i squeel and stretch like a little girl when i wake up instead of waking up frozen and unable to hardly breathe feelingv90 years old i do things i get up let me repeat that i get up if you are where i was youll know just how huge that is and my little disease that ketamine is also indicated for iswell actually it isnt and ive begun to successfully begin reducing opioid pain meds 5 reduction and only 3 days but hey if you only knew what a big deal that is anyway im just a weirdo on the internet so dont listen to me if this sounds good to you do your homework talk to your doctor im not one ok not even close just beware that a lot of doctors scoff at any thing not on their fda approval list or that isnt a big pharma drug they can get a kick back on so you know make sure its safe to take it by all means but remember some doctors are good and some are bad always look out for you beware its contraindicated for anyone on ssri maoi read the label before taking any drug one last thing there a prescription drug neudexta that uses dextromethorphan with quinidine quinidine is just a prescription med that makes the dex extended release but because quinidine is prescription only they could add it and essentially then make otc cough medicine prescription only and sell an 8 med you can get at any drug store for god only knows how much big pharma such greedy sinsters however their website is useful in how to use the medication and how much they rx this for a brain condition called pseudobulbar affect have no doubt dextromethorphan is a brain drug it even prevents coughing via the brain anyway their website has some useful information particularly that only very tiny doses are required to get dramatic benefits very tiny i know there may be one other person on the edge out there looking for an answer who doesnt want to suffer any more and this just might be the answer and this post is for that person who knows but if its safe for you to take it you can ask a pharmacist too its so easy to get its cheap and it could save your life good luck remember to to do your homework and i love you all,1

sleeping with my gfs mum i dont know where to go from here i live in a pretty big town however there are only three decent clubs so its pretty common to bump into the same strangers every now and then a couple of months ago i was at this nice rock bar with a live band drinking with a big group of work friends i notice a blonde woman has glanced over a few times so i go up to her make some smalltalk and ask for her number as i couldnt really leave my friends we text a little bit but nothing came of it a week later i bump into her again and we talk for longer decide to grab a couple drinks and i end up going back to her house to spend the night i noticed she was a lot older maybe around 40 than anyone else ive slept with before and im 21 so pretty much double my age but she looked good so i figured id learn a thing or two all ive learnt now is how to regret more efficiently i move on and forget about her a couple of weeks ago i met a girl 19 on tinder we hit it off and after a few really good dates she invites me back to her place i live a 20min drive away as i walk down the street i notice its the same one as my previous bonk my heart sank when i watched this lovely girl turn to face me say this is me while gesturing to the same door that i went through for a cheap one night stand i suddenly see the resemblence quickly i compliment her house and ask her how long she had lived there grasping at some flimsy straws my whole life pretty much just my parents lil sister and the dog she replies everyone was home i knew this i had to tell her she was shocked very shocked when she realised that i wasnt joking when i got her mums name right i knew she was levelheaded from our first few dates so thankfully she actually understood and didnt attack me for it we do agree we cant keep seeing eachother duh but i really did like her which can be rare for me so it fucking sucks she didnt mention her parents marriage and i dont want to ask i also dont know how the house was free a couple of months ago all i know is i fucked up tldr slept with older woman at her house girlfriendtobe invites me in the very same house i realize my last lover was her mother i tell her no more gf2b,0

sick flags magic mountain attention first ever post here guys actually first ever post so today i was clearing through my phone numbers this summer i had a crazy summer of fucked up tinder dates lols this one happened about 6 months ago and i came across this number who made me think back to this fucked up story it was the middle of summer after my birthday because i remember meeting my homie right after my birthday and this happened when my homie and i were chillin i had been talking to this dude for a while vibin lets just call himleo in no way shape or form is his name leo by the way at this point ive been playing the tinder game for a few months i had recently broke up with my abusive boyfriend of nearly 2 years so i wanted to just get back up on my feet and to meet new people i guess lol anyways leo and i have been talking for about a week he is in the military which i was hesitant on meeting because my ex was in the military as well and lets just say we did not get along well but he was nice enough we had goodmoderate conversation at least through text we talked about some really stupid shit that made him interesting enough to engage him in banter we talked about the places he travelled to and what we liked to do for fun i responded with the typical shit people like to do eat mukbangs watch movies hiking gym amusement parks etc he mentioned that he loved rollercoasters and he bet i couldnt handle it but in fact i love rollercoasters i mentioned that six flags was my favorite amusement park because i feel like no other park can satisfy my thrill seeking needs then he proceeds to offer to take me out on an amusement park date i actually scoffed irl when i read this because thats really expensive especially for a first date although plenty of other guys have spent more on me on a first date before but thats another storytime for another day i replied that i had to decline because i am a poor ass college student lol and he proceeded to tell me no he would pay for it and not to worry about the price i thought wow what a nice dude plus who could turn down a free all expense paid trip to six flags magic mountain is you crazy so i immediately jumping on his offer and i said yes without thinking jump in time its a week later ive been thinking the whole week about the date because im fucking nervous i have legit never been on a date where im stuck in a scenario where i am forced to get to know some one in an amusement park setting that shit is fucking scary when you think about it what kept running through my head that whole week were scenarios of whatifs what if leo was a serial killer six flags is far from me and i would be stuck in the car with him and i suck at directions so he could be driving me off to timbuktru and i wouldnt even know it what if we just dont get along irl and it would be an awkward 56 hrs because it would be a waste if we just went back home as soon as we got there what if he was some stalker that would creep on me forever because he knows where i live so long story short i had my doubts at this point of the summer my homie and i hung out and smoked and worked out practically everyday this particular day was a day before the said date my homie and i were really close and we always shared the tea on our tinder dates to each other all the time i kept telling my homie how nervous i was for tomorrows date and he suggested that i should take a dab and let my worries fade away naturally i agreed and i took the fattest dab one that just lets you ride waves ya know one moment youre watching a movie chillin and smokin pot with your homie the next youre waking up late af around noon and mind you leo and i havent set a time yet leo texting you to give him the address to my place so he can tell me the eta of when he could get to me i apologised and explained how accidentally woke up late and that if he was on his way to take his time because i was going to take a while to get ready he was very nice about it and was adamant on taking me out because he had already bought the tickets he also apparently made some bomb ass cookies and he wanted to give me some from his coworker party or something and before people chime in on the sketch alert thing he did send me pics of his homies and shit i trust him enough to consider going on a date with him at this time anyways it was already a damper when we couldnt get a head start on our day but also that i had to get ready and go back to my place for him to pick me up for our date i wasnt about to ask him to come pick me up at my homies place that would he too far and awkward but as it got later in the day leo was driving from norcal and he was coming down to see family down here in socal that it wasnt a big deal i ended up smoking way too much when yes i should have been on the road at this point heading back to my place but i was just sooooo fucking lazy at this point that i didnt even want to get out of bed 1 hour later he texts me hey are you ready im at the starbucks next to yours fuck i have wasted the day away and hes already there waiting for me and i am still 30 minutes away i didnt expect the weed to kick in so hard that i completely lost track of time i couldnt even think of a bullshit excuse i didnt have the heart to tell him so i just panicked and ghosted him i know shame on me i was repaid tenfold with other tinder horror stories so karma definitely caught up with me ps to the nice gentleman out there who i have wasted their time and money i deeply apologize i hope you had nice dates there forth tl dr basically i didnt mean to turn down a potentially nice tinder date to six flags because i had my doubts and the guy already made it basically to my doorstep but i wasnt even at home because i was kickin it with my homie smoking weed and i lost track of time instead of responding like a decent human should i acted kinda shitty and ghosted him i really hope he can forgive me or he gets to go on that really cool amusement park date with a super cool gal,0

while at a doctorsclinic tifu badly back story im on a clinical trial for a medical treatment which involves the taking of blood every month receiving a couple of injections every month and having a through medical including an ecg every 3 months today was my 3mth medical which includes fasting ive been on the trial for a little over 2yrs today i turned up for my appointment which was scheduled at almost lunchtime which meant that i was already a little bit light headed been fasting since 7pm the night before and started to go through the process of being checked out today the nurse and trial doctor both females were in a particular joking mood which made stripping down to my jocks a little less uncomfortable after going through all the necessary medical checks dont forget this is a medical trial it was time for me to get up on the table for the ecg once all the sticky sensor pads are put on my legswristsand chest the nurse drops all the cords on my stomach to start sorting out what went where and the leads seemed to all be dragged over my crotch when everything was attached the nurse then plugged it all into the main monitorbox and dropped it all onto mr wobbly then she stood there using my leg like a bar leaner and chatted to the doctor meanwhile i have to lie there perfectly still for a positive reading still feeling lightheaded then something funny was said the nurse laughed and i will swear to the day i die her hand brushed my inner thigh cue mr wobbly to pop up and have a look around bastard the ecg slid off my crotch and the nurse managed to catch it before it hit the floor it completed its scan and while they uploaded my results i got my jabs and was allowed to get dressed in silence everything was fine and we made a date and time for my next appointment as i left and walked out i closed the door but through the walls i heard the doctor say to the nurse at least we can rule out impotence as a side affect and with the laughter still ringing in my ears i slunk out tl dr went to see a female doctor and nurse cracked a fat one in front of them despite what you see on redditpornvids we did not get it on,0

how should i 17m tell my recently long distanced close friend that i have feelings for her 17f alright so this might end up long winded and verbose in an attempt to accurately describe the situation and how i feel so ive known this girl for a while about 4ish 5ish 6ish years we recently started geting closer as friends these past few years and even closer these past few months like pretty close ive always had some sort of more than friends feeling for her didnt act on it because i was pretty young then got older and had already started seeing this other girl earlier 2018 that ended pretty bad for me story for another time i guess fast foward she starts appearing more frequently in my life coincidence it wasnt really until october 2018 almost four months ago that i really felt it and it only grew from there i found out around october that they as in her and her family were moving away mid december 34 hours away november hit i realized i need to act fast we connected a bunch played some music together pretty darn cute if i do say so myself started texting a bunch lots of feels then late november early december things complicate and they end up leaving early leaving some unfinished things here i came up with a really great sensitive emotional thoughtful gift to show her how i felt it was a book she wanted five feet apart fitting right i had printed some pictures of us wrote a bunch of notes on the back of each one and hid them between the pages i also came up with something pretty darn cute to write inside the cover distance is not measured in miles but affection no distance is too far and no time too long distance gives us all the more reason right there are some bonds no distance can break i hope ours never will and something on the back pretty dang slick no on some of the notes i had brought up the idea of us going out and kinda conveyed how i felt but at the same time not not straight up flat out if that makes any sense point is if anything was gonna make her fall for me this would she came back after they had worked out the hiccups a few times to finish up somethings here i should mention that most of the time we hang out is with her and her older sister me and my older sister and a few other people but this last time only she came back she texted only me around 8ish that she was in town i had eagerly asked if she wanted to do something we talked about going out what seemed to me just us two a date i was so nervous i was texting a friend for help and suggestions everything was closed so she eagerly suggested a movie at her house and i couldnt tell if she was meaning just me or my sister as well it kinda seemed that way but i didnt want to ruin anything had she wanted a specific way so i invite my sister to the enragement of my other friend and we watch a movie at her house it was then i gave her that gift fast forward a little while she opens it says it was the most thoughtful thing not exactly what i hoped she would say fast forward a day or two she tells me how much she enjoys me and compared me to chocolate cute right fast forward a day or two she tells me about how in the book the girl finds a really cute creative way to ask the guy out and how she wished she was able to do something like that to which i replied with how i wished i was able to do that she then tells me that idk i thought you had did a pretty great job with the book the next day she talks about the end of the book and tells me shes excited for the movie i said that i didnt know if i would enjoy the movie based off how the book ended and said that there was really one way for me to find out she then suggested either reading the book or watching the movie both of which she wanted me to do with her tldr so here i am now 314 am seeking the help of random strangers after a bunch of somewhat hinting texts and encounters and mixed emotions and signs i mentioned in my story above some big things that i thought might be signs but i am terrible at picking up hints especially after what my last experience was i know were young but i could wait but for that i need to know how she feels were almost out of high school and this is something i want in life i think its somthing i should pursue but i dont want to ruin anything should i tell her should i wait a little while ps im hoping maybe i could tell her face to face if im able to see her again soon alone maybe at the movie she wanted to watch with me,0
i like people who tell me they will get better than me at something so juts as the title says i like it when someone tells me mostly its someone from my friend circle that they will get better than me i feel really proud and happy that i have inspired them to do better and that they have me as their benchmark like for example a friend of mine recently started going to the gym with me and he is a bit on the healthy side and cant always keep up with the high intensity exercise i do but he mentioned a few days back that he might not match my stamina yet but he will get there and eventually even get better than me i was so proud of him to me it meant that he is willing to put in as much if not more effort to better himself and that he thinks that i am worthy i was deeply humbled it also motivated me to push harder and be a better benchmark for him to overcome thats it i wanted to share that with you guys have a good day,0

is there still a chance for me f 21 with my ex24 m i miss my ex so much im 21 my ex is 24 we dated for 3 years and he was there all throughout my freshmen year of college and we would facetime audio all night every single night falling asleep to each other it was long distant relationship but later down the road i ended up dropping him for another guy that ive met but after dating that guy and another guy i realized that i missed my first ex and loved him the most out of all the guys i dated and missed what we had the most but the thing is that i hurt him immensely and put him through a lot of pain when i ignored him those times he kept trying to chase after me i feel so shitty about all the things i did in the past he cried countless times trying to reach out to me but i refused to listen to him and kept on ignoring him now i regret it immensely because i contacted him a while ago to wish him happy birthday and found out he has a girlfriend now that lasted less than a month and said that shes very special and that he loves her a lot im happy that he found someone but also extremely sad that him and i will never be again i had so many amazing memories with this man and knowing that they came to a halt is soul wrenching its been 12 days since the no contact period has started and im struggling to get him off my mind i mean i do go out and do things but my mind keeps coming back to him from time to time i cant help if but want to do everything in my power to get him back please help i have horrible self restraint and i fear that i might do something incredibly stupid like drive all the way to his house 5 hrs away and bring im sorry posters and millions of teddy bears i mean i would totally do it but theres absolutely zero chance now since he has a girlfriend now tldr is there a chance for my ex to get back with me even though he has a girlfriend now theyve been together for a month now,0

an open world animal game idea i thought of sorry its not organize but ima do it sooni jus wanted to hurry and get it all out make a singleplayer and multiplayer and online open world animal game with realistic graphic and animation and animals like cats rabbits dogs squirrels raccoons hedgehogs foxes weasels owls hawks mice badgers wolves seagulls and etc and maybeif u canmake it so you can create your own map by addin trees and plants and grass and rocks and rivers and lakes and ponds and neighborhoods and cities and mountains and hillsbut make the map big as hell and have different biome area like forest and open moors city towns and neighborhoods snowy mountain and a snowy area and snow forest and hills and stuff and basically thats itbut have the map be big and maybe 2 cities and couple different forest areas and snowy areas with rivers and lakes and dens burrows caves nests for the animalsand maybe make it so when ur a dog or cat u can go to da neighborhoods and get an owner if u make one of the humans like u and sum of the humans will have family so u can be in a family home or they just be a couple wit no kids or just one person and they feed u food and water in bowls and it never gets empty and u can go out da cat flap on da door and maybe a dog flap for da dogs or u jus bark at da door and the owner comes and u can go out an open window if ur a cat and if its a high window near a tree u can jump to da tree and climb down and cats and squirrels can be able to climb trees and sum of the animals can dig swim and stuff and mate and have babiesand u can choose if u want 16 to be born and u can carry them depending what animal u are and rabbits can go on the farm and steal crops to eat like carrots and carry them back and u can switch from different members of ur packgroupfamily and make them grab and carry something and then switch back to ur main animal and theyll follow u still carrying whatever they had and u can command them to stay somewhere or follow or patrol and area for danger or foodand have the seasons change whenever u want them to instead of them changing naturally u can just change it urselflike maybe hold the big middle button and an interaction menu pops up like in gta5 director mode and u can change a lot of the stuff from there like the name of ur members ur animal and the time of day and season and weather and how the moon looks and where itll be in the sky also where the sun will be at and the snow wont build up like gta5 online on christmas itll just be snow on the ground as soon as u make it winter and u can make it snow or not snow or a blizzard and u can hunt for prey and also catch fish and find nuts and plants to eat and even out the trash in the alley or snatch food from people or sneak into fast food places or eat at ur owners house and in the fall season the leaves would be falling but the leaves in trees would stay in the trees but itll be 3 or 6 leaves falling from the trees and there will be leaves on the ground and sum of the trees would have red yellow or orange leaves and people would be rakin leaves into piles in their yards and in winter sum of the trees would have no leaves and in spring a lot more flowers would be around and stuff and itll rain more but u can also make the rain stopand maybe u can run by holdin r2 and jump by pressin x and eat by holdin o circle only when ur near food and make the animal noise by pressin down on r3 like gta5 and fight by pressin square and catch fishes by pressin square and carry stuff by holdin triangle and be able to go in first person mode maybe and be able to look all around and up at the sky with the cameracuz u cant do it in gta5 as a animal which is dumb and be able to leap and sit on walls and tree branchs if ur a cat and a animal that can do thatand fly around and snatch small animals up if ur a hawk or owl by pressin square when ur flyin near a small animal and be able to sit by pressin down on l3 once and to lay by pressin it again and sleep by pressin it again and when u press it again you stand up and maybeif u make it onlinemake it so atleast 20 30 people to a world or more if u can and make it so u can go to the menu when u press the option button u can see the whole map in color in good detail as if it was a picture from above the mapkinda like the gta5 interactive map is and make it so u can create a online serverbut call them worlds in the game and name them and put info to what is going onlike if its a roleplay or play as specific animal world and you can see all the players who are in the world before u join and u can choose which one u wanna go to unlike gta5 where it puts u in whatever it wants and also make it so u can switch animals using the interaction menu holdin the big middle button and switch animals and itll be a light around the player and itll switch the animal or make it so it just fades into that animal but if ya cant do dat then do whatever but dont make the whole screen go black then it come back and ur another animal and none of the animals need to be unlocked and there wont be no missionsjust and open world survival gameyou will have unlimited sprint but need to eat and drink or your health will go down if either of the food or water bars are empty and when u die u respawn at whatever spawn point u are closer to and itll be 10 spawn points bc the map will be big and the area surrounding the map would be mountains and u wont be able to go pass them bc an invisible barrier will stop u like most gamesand the neighborhood and city and town areas wouldnt be at the edges of the map bc the mountains would be there and maybe add a urban area near the bottom of map and one at the top in the snowy area and add train tracks that go around the map to both the cities and add abandoned houses that animals can go in and also add a text chat and voice chat but make the voice chat like u have to choose from some voices you want other people to hear and u can change it in the interaction menu and u can make it so nothing is on the screen like no huds and stuff and the map wont be on the screen it will only be on the menu when u press options and u can set waypoints but have to keep goin back to map to look at it and also make it so u can choose from 3 different sound distances and when ur changing it itll be a circle around ur animal showin how far its gonna be so anyone in that circle will be able to hear u so if u only want the people right next to u to hear u bc ya might be sneakin up on people thatll be sound distance 1 and itll be the smallest and 2 it will be so like anyone in the area ur at can hear u so like if ur at a river and ur on one side the person across from u on the other side can hear u too but in number 1 only the person right next to u or in front of u can hear u and number 3 will be the largest and anyone around u on the map can hear u but not the whole world can hear u and also u can choose who u want to hear u so only that person or those people can hear ulike a private chat and they can be close to u or on the other side of map and add a couple barns and farms and rivers and streams and stuff like that and maybe add places thatll be known like a huge tree called the great tree or a river called the blue and have places like these name marked on the map and make these spawn points where they can fast teleport to and maybe an abandoned house can be a spawn point and the respawn points wont be the same as the fast travel spawn pointsso only when u die u go to a nearby respawn point andback to the diggingu can dig holes to live in and make burrows or add more burrows to an existing oneand only certain animals can dig a hole or burrow to live whilst the fox dog and cat and other animals like them can only dig small holes just to put sum food they caught in or something they grabbed and itll be marked on the map where they made a hole so they can go back to itand thats all ima type upand if u cant make the gameatleast show someone this and give them the idea and put it into considerationand im 16 and dont kno how to make games i sent this to rockstar and copied and pasted it here a lot of us like

tifu by creeping out my ex girlfriend this fuck up occured around 34 in the morning after a night of drinking pardon the formatting im on mobile and very hungover backstory so about 45 years ago i dated this girl lets call her summer for about 910 months we attended university together and met when i was a freshman and she was a junior she was my first serious girlfriend and was the first person i ever said i love you to the relationship seemed to work well but eventually she broke up with me for reasons im still not 100 clear on admittedly i was pretty broken up about it for a while but eventually i moved on and started dating again its been a few years since weve spoken to each other but at least on my end there are no hard feelings now after dating around and going through a few failed relationships since recently i have started to see this girl well call her autumn and things are going well she is an extremely charming kind charismatic and beautiful person who i am trying really hard not to fuck things up with the fuck up last night around midnight my friend well call him tyson calls me and tells me that were going out drinking im already on the verge of going to sleep and really not in the mood but then i figure eh its a friday night might as well try and have some fun for some reason i decide that since im going out so late my only option to catch up is to drink copious amounts of whiskey within the time it took me to get dressed and get out the door about a half hour i manage to get down just under a half of a fifth if jack daniels not the best idea ive ever had considering my once impressive alcohol tolerance has dwindled to that of a middle schooler by the time i got to the bar i was already regretting my decisions but it was too late to turn back after sitting with a beer for a few minutes tyson walks in with some people i have never met nor do i remember them this morning and starts ordering shots of tequila for everyone i partake in the festivities for another hour or so and get truly drunk at this point who should walk in but autumn i casually go over to her and manage to string together enough words to form coherent speech after about 30 minutes of us sharing a playful banter she says that she is tired and starts to go home we kiss goodbye and she turns to leave but as i go back to my friend she stops me and says actually i was hoping to ask you why you dont text me that often i go on to try and explain that i just really dislike texting i feel as though i lose all of my charm through texts and that it has a negative impact on my relationships however in my drunken state it really sounds like more of an excuse she looked slightly upset at this and just said okay before leaving making me feeling like a huge ass i return to the bar and continue drinking for a while before tyson and i are booted out after last call tyson and i begin our walk towards our homes we live in the same neighborhood when i tell him about what happened with autumn he tells me that im just being paranoid and that there is nothing wrong with texting but in an effort to prove my point i mention that my poor texting skills contributed to my inability to maintain a relationship with summer he says that i am full of shit so i proceed to pull out my phone and go through our facebook messages from when we were together we go through and laugh at a few of the dumb things i try to talk about over texts and then start talking about other things by the time i get home it is around 3304 in the morning and i am very very drunk as i stared up at my ceiling i started to think back to autumn and how i mightve hurt her feelings so i decide to shoot her a facebook message as i open my phone i come across the 45 year old convo between my ex and myself and find that on many of her messages i have left a reaction for those of you that dont know as i only found out last night if you hold your finger onto a message on the messenger app it brings up a little display showing the different emoji reactions you can have to said messages one of these stupid things is a smiley face with hearts for eyes somewhat resembling this somehow as i had scrolled through the messages i had left roughly a dozen of these fuckers throughout the convo i panicked and removed them as soon as i found them i scrolled through several more times and found no trace of the little bastards so i proceeded to go to bed assuming the situation was rectified cue to this morning and i go to ensure that everything is fine when i find that summer has removed me from social media i can only imagine the cringe she must of had when she saw that an ex from college did something like that tldr accidently left a bunch of bizarre emojis in a four year old conversation with an ex she got creeped out and removed me from social media,0
tonight i witnessed a nasty crash after a guy ran a red light i stayed with him for almost two hours after and gave him a hug before i left so i was on my way home after a boring night at work staring into space doing security bullshit typical night nothing interesting ado et cetera i was on the last leg of my commute just 5 miles away from my apartment when i was pulling up to the light at a major intersection about a hundred feet from the stop line a guy in a white honda accord sped up towards the light accelerating towards a line of stopped cars my thought process was about as follows car speeds past uhh you cant be this dumb theres a red light there car dives into right turn lane to barrel past the stopped cars well proved me wrong i guess this is gonna be a special kind of dumb car speeds into intersection cuts back across the traffic thats currently taking left turn into main road predictably slams into a car just barely managing to not jump the median into oncoming traffic after bashing one car really hard in the left rear corner sighs mother fuck so though i just got off work from my security guard gig my feet hurt and i was kinda hungry i take it upon myself to do the good samaritan thing and pull off to the side of the road and see if anyone was hurt the car that was hit turned out to be a lincoln town car latemid 2000s model built like a fucking house thing lost a taillight basically but everyone inside was fine at least fine enough i dialed 911 as soon as i saw that the three occupants inside the victims car were alright gave them the where and how who was involved and how many people all that jazz they said they were on their way then the call ended the driver of the accord comes up and starts asking if theyre alright in there seems kinda distant nothing bad enough to make me think hes intoxicated most likely a little jolted from the crash i figured i made a mental note of the guys appearance and got back to watching everything ems made it there in less than 10 minutes during that time another person stopped to be a witness which gave me someone to sit and talk to while we waited after they got there they started their way over to the accord while a team worked on extracting the people in the lincoln they were all fairly big folks so they had to be slow with it while this happened i looked around and saw that they were putting crime scene tape around the completely wrecked accord this confused me but when a car drove past the crash i saw that there was nobody in the car dude flat out ran for it it looked like ems had two of the victims packed away and were working on pulling out the last one then out of the corner of my eye i see a guy that looks exactly like the driver of the honda minus a hat walking over to the crash it was him it turned out at first i was kinda cold to him i admit i didnt know what the hell he was thinking trying to run a red light on one of the busiest intersections within several miles but here he was back at the scene and visibly upset guy started making excuses and trying to justify everything that happened blaming his girlfriend blaming his car blaming the other driver at one point the other witness and i stood there and just talked with the guy while he went through all the stages of grief in front of us then after a while he just starts sobbing right there on the side of the road hes devastated he thinks hes possibly seriously hurt or killed someone and the fear and regret in his voice are very very real so here i am going from this guys an asshole with no regard for anyone but himself to geez this guy fucked up and he knows it poor bastard in a short enough span that im about to get whiplash myself so ems leaves and myself the second witness the driver and the drivers girlfriend stay at the crash scene waiting for the police to show up and all the while were just sitting there and talking like normal human beings the fact we were complete strangers in a rough part of town that one of us had caused a nasty accident a short while ago that one of us was fresh out of work while another was late to work because of the crash none of it mattered we just sat there and talked like friends it was totally fucking surreal so all the while were talking to the driver telling him that everything was going to be okay that the insurance policies would cover the crash itself and the medical bills of the driver and passengers of the other car we talked of our own tragedies and mishaps about the shit wed seen and the way it all worked out in the end about the people wed unintentionally hurt and the ways we atoned for it and that even in the worst of cases we humans are quite resilient and have a natural talent for recovering from the daily calamities that befall us the second witness had to run to work so i sat with the driver while we waited for the police from the point of impact it was an entire two hours before an officer arrived to take a statement and the entire time i was with the driver it was just straight up pleasant eventually the police finally showed in the form of a single highway patrol officer they must have been really slammed tonight to take two hours to get there but i digress i gave my statement without any real event and the guy went to his car to get his id and such out of it after i gave my statement id and number as well as the other witness information i was free to go i walked over to the driver after and i gave him a big hug and told him that everything was going to be alright gave him my number and told him id buy him a coffee sometime then got back on the road and went home i got home late but despite the annoyance id say it was worth the fuss now back to the internet and drowning myself in video games with my long distance girlfriend thanks for reading ya bastards,0

my last thoughts i wanted to come on here and tell my story of when it was the beginning of the end when i was a baby i was rapped by a family member i dont really remember what and how it happened but i was told later on in life when i was about 45 i was rapped by different family member and this time i did remember but wasnt sure if it was a dream or something that actually occurred which just about 2 years ago was confirmed it was real when i was in 4th grade i was sexually assaulted by a different person and then my dad was murdered which took me into a great depression because he was all i had after his death in 2010 i was rapped again by yet another person from 6th grade up until 8th grade and if that didnt seem like enough my freshman year it happened for the last time so i been rapped and sexually assaulted my entire life from different people and i know its sounds very dumb to say but it felt kinda normal like if this happened to everybody until i was asked about it at school because a counselor noticed some red flags i told them who it was at the moment and that person is currently in jail and because he was a family member my mom hated me for it she treated me like shit and proceed to make me feel like it was all my fault and that i was in the wrong i started looking for alternatives to escape my reality and started doing drugs and running away typical teenage things but i ended up pregnant at 15 my mom kicked me out and the father of my child took me in he cheated on me my whole pregnancy but i had no where to go so i forgave him and he has cheated on me the whole 5 years we have been together if im being honest but i stayed i didnt finish school its quite difficult to find a job and i stay home and watch the kid clean and cook ect a couple of months back we talked it out and he said it would be his last time cheating and i believed him on friday i had a mental breakdown i cried and cried and cried for hours about how much i hate my life and how bad i wanted to end it because i have no family no friends and i cant stop reliving my past im still heart broken about my dads death and to top it off im constantly worried about him cheating on me and he hugged me calmed me down and did everything he was suppose to do to and reassured me that i have him and thats all that should matter our little family yesterday night he fell asleep with him phone on and i felt like i had all the right to look threw it and he was indeed still cheating not with 1 not 2 not even with 3 but 5 females and ive havent stopped crying since idk what to do anymore after he sat there and watched me cry for hourssss he look me straight in my face and lied and now im on the edge all i was fighting for was us and i didnt even have that these are my last thoughts and i cant wait to end the torture that is my life once and for all,1

am i in the wrong m22 and f25 fwb for 6 months hello everybody so a year ago i met this girl through a friend we spend the whole summer with the three of us and i developed feelings for this girl which ended up in me telling her i was in love she did not love me that way and that was the end of that however we ended up having some sort of fwb we did not have actual sex yet i consider this girl my best friend two months into our fwb she distanced herself from me probably because of my feelings for her i then kissed someone else while going out she did not like it and that was the end of our fwb for the time being after a month we grew back together and the fwb continued now i know she does not like me kissing someone and then coming back to her i get that i did that because i felt lonely anyway the feeling of being hopelessly in love has gone but i still love her and if shes into it i would start a relationship as soon as possible and she knows that i told her that i have to be open to other girls because i will get stuck otherwise okay so now something happened and im not sure whether i am guilty of doing something bad and what to do now a niece of mine hooked me up with a friend of hers and we had drinks with the three of us a month later i send the girl in question a message nothing happened and nothing will my fwb saw a text from her and she knew about me meeting her she went silent and i asked her what was wrong she said that if i was serious about her i should end the fwb with her i agreed and was planning to end it as soon as i saw potential is that too late she though so she asked if i texted her first i lied thats on me she asked if i had contact with her a few days after her reading the text i lied only because i wanted to slowly let everything bleed out so now everything is good again i know more about how see sees our fwb and what see expects of me but i have lied about several things and feel bad about this she puts honesty on a pedestal and the fact that i lied to her face does hurt me why did i lie because i knew that if i told her the truth our friendship as a whole would be in danger she can react very strong to these things i lied because i think this whole situation is not worth fighting over or losing our friendship or fwb over our fwb mostly consist of handwork anyway there is a big chance that she will find out about this someday most lies get found out if this happens she will be very mad i just dont think this whole situation is worth getting mad about were not exclusive she doesnt want to i do and we do not even have sex and she knows i have to be open to other girls i recently also have asked another girl for her number which she does not know about this is also something i feel guilty for not telling about have i done something wrong should i tell her i lied or just keep my mouth shut and consider this a necessary lie and learn from it im just so confused i have never even been in a real relationship i have no idea tldr i am in a fwb situation with a girl i want to start a relationship with but she does not want a relationship so i keep my eyes open for a girl i can connect with and who does my niece hooked me up with someone and my fwb found out and got mad i then lied about several facts which i now feel guilty about i never contacted the girl i got hooked up with again and am planning to just let things go and when i really want to find someone end things with my fwb keep in mind that i really care for my fwb and that she cared about me too you can call us best friends,0

telling all of you this story right here hello to my exboyfriend reupload as my post is constantly being removed because my tl dr wasnt descriptive enough or something else just let me tell my story gosh darn it so my dear beloved internet here is a story for you my ex boyfriend and i went our seperate ways a while ago he was the first real love of my life and for years made me believe that i was his too after he decided to break it off with me things started to get real wild he used multiple methods people circumstances and my strong feelings for him to emotionally and physically abuse me to the point where i had serious suicidal thoughts and was diagnosed with severe post traumatic stress disorder he had also left me at a time where i would have needed him more than anything he made me go through hell for the past months he repeatedly told me with full knowledge of what he could cause and that i was already struggling with depression and anxiety that i was a burden to everyone in my life that i was a worthless piece of shit that he never loved me and i never meant anything to him he told me that he used me because he didnt want to be alone he thought it was hilarious making jokes as he told me all these horrible things repeatedly i was stupid enough to listen to his sadism over the course of many months and it didnt stop there i was made to believe that i was ugly appaling not worthy anyones love or friendship or affection he made me believe that i didnt deserve to live during all this i was still naive and stupid enough to attempt to make peace with him and talk things out on countless occasions which he only ever used to mistreat me more a few days ago just when i had finally with the help of my family and friends gathered the strength to walk away from him and accept that he would never change he texted me he told me that hed tell my father about all the illegal things i had allegedly done basically threatening me with the last thing he could use against me that he hadnt already used my father and i are not on good terms and we hardly ever speak still i am financially dependent on him because i am still at university however i am not at all afraid of my father on the contrary i was despite everything he had done to me concerned for my ex boyfriends wellbeing my father is not the type of father anyone would want to be messing around with despite everyone telling me to leave him to his fate i still chose to contact him to ask him not to do it explaining that he really shouldnt ever contact my father if he cared for his own life and health and his answer to this act of basic decency is the whole reason i am now telling the whole community of reddit about this the answer was this pictureurl featuring him and one of his many many girls a written message was enclosed containing the words theres no place for you here fuck off and take your brain farts somewhere else despite the horribleness of situation i of course had to laugh at the word farts my exboyfriend takes a lot of pride in the number of girls he has been going through these past few months i know that because he took pleasure in telling me about it if what he told me is true hes also currently with a girl whom he is allegedly in love with just like he was in love with 9 other girls that i know of that he said the same exact thing about including myself all of these girls without exception have been disappointed and had their hearts broken by him in various ways but none of them he ever tortured nearly as much as he tortured me after hes sent me this little porn picture i have finally decided not to be the victim of his games anymore ive decided to walk away now rebuild my selfworth and my mental health and realize that i am and always will be too good for a sadistic inhumane egomaniac who will never again be capable of true love or happiness right now he is on his first vacation with his new playtoy so with this little story and with the knowledge that he is reading this i want to say the following i wish you all the best on your vacation baby tldr my exboyfriend and i broke up a while ago after which he emotionally abused me for months after i tried to help him despite everything he had done to me he chose to send me a picture of him and another girl in bed as a reply now i decided to walk away and tell my story right here on reddit and for clarification this is a fuckup because it could very well lead to him trying to sue me d,0
for real though why is arrested development so goddamn funny a partially rhetorical question perhaps but thought maybe it would be fun to discuss ive loved the show ever since it was first broadcast on fox i bought all the seasons on dvd as soon as they came out so ive watched every episode of the original series countless times over the last 16 years i know every episode by heart so youd think that by now it wouldnt seem as fresh and funny to me but after deciding to rewatch all of them on a whim after not having watched them for a few years its still as if im watching it for the first time there has never been another show that has me literally in tears from laughing so hard and i love all the tv comedy greats like seinfeld the simpsons 30 rock its always sunny etc etc but ad is different obviously you could boil it down to the writing and the talent of the actors mitchell hurwitz and the other writers are literal geniuses to be able to craft such clever jokes gags puns and scenarios and put it altogether into a coherent story and making it all relate takes otherworldly skills in my opinion and the other ingredient is the talent of the actors there isnt anyone on that show who wasnt superb in their roles but what about the writing and acting makes it especially funny is it that we all know people like that and so its really relatable is it that the things they say and do are all things we secretly think and feel is it that we all subconsciously realize how stupid a lot of life is and we need comedy to validate that for us maybe its all of those things and more or maybe im thinking too deeply about it,0

is this a relationship dealbreaker my bf 30yo offered his single female friend to come stay with us in his place rent free without consulting me first i need help this is long and ranty and i am very sorry but i need to know if my relationship is worth salvaging at this point i just need to gain different insight to see if im wasting my time with this guy or if i am completely overreacting so i am in a bit of a relationship jam here and any input and feedback would honestly be much appreciated because i am not thrilled at the idea of talking to my family about this and i feel like dirty laundry is best aired with complete strangers sounds odd i know after what has happened im honestly starting to lose the attraction and respect for my boyfriend that i once had and i want to see if i overreacted to this situation or if this is bad enough to be a dealbreaker he gave me no red flags leading up to this and there are usually red flags in situations like this so backstory my 30 yo bf and i 27 yo female have been happily dating exactly 1 year happy wonderful and sometime last year after we had been dating a few months he decided he wanted to reconnect with his sadly now deceased male friends girlfriend who is single and dating 34 yo well call her betsy he wanted to get back in touch with betsy to remember his friend who had died a few years back so they could share awesome memories of him together which i initially thought was amazing but plainly put betsy is causing a bit of a stir between he and i and i didnt want to believe before that it was intentional on her part but i have to trust my gut and my bs meter is sadly on high alert with her and i have every reason to feel like my bf should probably stay away from her because its glaringly obvious that she is a bonafide crapstarter she is allegedly a christian however i didnt realize until last week when we hung out with her for the 3rd time that she wears an overly zealous and insufferably imposing personality to go along with her faith she never talks about other peoples accomplishments only herself is very boastful about all the good deeds shes done all the money shes donated and volunteering and she doesnt seem to care to ask anyone about themselves and interrupts within seconds if she does since she needs to be the only one talking oh and she also plainly states that she hates women and thinks most women have evil wicked hearts huge red flag 1 and ill throw in a 2 as well sltshaming misogyny with a game wholesome smile on her face is her game and nah were not in the 21st century with feminism and human rights or activism or anything so 5 months ago was our 2nd time spending time with this quite enigmatic young lady it was more pleasant hanging out with her the 2nd time to say the very least and this past weekend was the 3rd time my boyfriend and i had the wonderful privilege sarcasm of hanging out with her so backtrack to 5 months ago i had clearly told him after we had hung out with her that i didnt feel comfortable what she was texting him because she was asking him if she could come over to his house and take care of him and she was not asking about me or my whereabouts whatsoever jn the text she sent him she offered things like to bring him vitamins and make some soup one of her later texts in that cringey conversation with him had just shown up on my boyfriends phone at a time he and i were both looking at his phone and he offered to show me what she had sent to him i would never snoop i trusted my bf at the time and wouldnt snoop even now that i dont trust him as much so after reading what this betsy lady wrote to my boyfriend i kinda saw red for a moment and just laughed and i thought what the actual f and i began to cringelaugh and then i felt fine once i read his response he had politely rescinded her offer to come over to his house i wasnt living with him nor am i now but my movein with him has been in the works for about 4 months now and its something we are definitely planning we are very honest and open with each other in many ways so we were confident that it will happen when its meant to after i had plainly told him that her text made me quite uncomfortable he said yeah i had a feeling you wouldnt like what she said so i thought and told him well babe now that i think about it shes christian and i am too and i realize i have to take that into account so knowing that i can say that what she said sits better with me and i trust her even thoughwhat she said is still really inappropriate i think she means well though its justyou and her just started hanging out again after not seeing each other or talking for 2 yearscould she just respect what we have and wait til we or you can hang out with her somewhere in public i would just like to get to know her more so he said that he agreed and for her to come over when im not there would be overstepping his boundaries as wellhe would always make sure that if he were to ever invite her over he would definitely make sure i was present and no he didnt find what she said appropriate either but knew she had good intentions only because of her faith we left it at that fast forwarding to 5 months later last weekend we hang out with betsy again im sorry to say it but after this night i came to the realization that this girl is a trainwreck narcissistic sweet talking charismatic disturbing convictions a charlatan and a trainwreck up until now i fell for the act too i thought she was lovely inspiring had a giving heart maybe really annoying but what i saw this 3rd time was just a new drastic development she proudly stated that she hates women thinks very few women have good intentions blah blah and i cant bear it when people lack so much perspective on the world and on peoples situations so i shut her comment down real fast albeit in a polite loving way i also noticed that she was throwing pretty obvious slights at me throughout the night and one of them was thrown at me even before the moment i shut down her misogynistic comment and she said it in front of my bfand one slight she made was for my shoes i was wearing this was her reaction after i just lightly commented that my feet were hurting after a long night from my half inch sandals she said oh honey thats why i hate heels haha you know i dont have to be wearing heels to impress no man yes she isnt very bright is she and even when she first got in the car with us when we were about to go out for the evening she addressed me as poor little my name when the topic of abduction sooomehow came up by her welp so much for a lighthearted topic to get a convo rolling debby downer saves the day and she was going on about how she knew all the combative self defense moves for her and my bf to rescue poor old me if i were to get abducted painting herself as a strong dominant female and me as a damsel in distress biiish please it was a weak dig on her part and i let it slide though and i didnt let it offend me this was the first kne of the night and i called her out on the other one i did however take note that my bf didnt come to my defense in either one though both times she pulled that he looked at me to see what my reaction would be i also didnt notice previously but betsy has some violent thoughts and verbalizes them under the guise of jokes even towards members of law enforcement the most subtle of which was when she was joking with a cop telling him that shes going to step on his fellow colleagues toe if he doesnt bring back her beloved pocket knife that he promised he would after confiscating it from her in the security line before an event we went to this is her logic oh but im a licensed and trained paramedic with sooo much life experience and i have plenty of cops as my buddies so i can get away with comments like that around a whole different breed of police officers no problem i dont care if i make the people around me super uncomfortable thank god the cop just humored her andor thought rightfully so that she was a basketcase sadly what happened next was what tipped things over for me she had overstepped the boundaries a second time and this time it wasnt a text this was actually effed up what she did at the end of the night this is what happened one of her sob stories actually won my boyfriend over and i dont know if it was just a misunderstanding that i just by unfortunate coincidence just happened to not be present during this sob story display she made to him in order for me to gain some sort of context and understanding as to what they would be talking about later on at the end of the night either it was unfortunate coincidence or more than likely whatever voodoo she was working on my boyfriend at the time and she wanted to wait til i wasnt around a convo that i was away from for all of 7 minutes tops as i had to use the ladies room but apparently during this time they had more than enough time to have a conversation about her finances he said later on that he brought it up asking her about how her business was going and then evidently she opened up to him and in 7 minutes she told him everything about her hardships she might lose everything because her self made cleaning business isnt going so well she cant pay her bills etc to be clear the last time we talked to her 5 months ago everything seemed to be going fine she bought us dinner and there was no mention of her going through hardships she would later lie about that in a text to me and look i realize things happen and people have struggles come into their lives in very short periods of time and i empathize with them not just because i know what its like but because i want to help them in any way i can and when it happened to me i didnt even have support at the time she however has plenty of support and plenty of friends my bf knows this however i just thought it was extremely suspect that i wasnt there when she put this weird branch of divided loyalties into my boyfriends head she knew what he would say or what he would offer i guess but i certainly didnt see it coming i was completely blindsided needless to say i had no idea this conversation between them even happened until later that night when i was boiling next to my boyfriend in bed after what he had said to her in the car on our way back to drop her off this is what he said i was trying to sleep during the ride home and i told them so they knew my eyes were closed in the front passenger seat but i was conscious very much awake and heard it all my boyfriend said to her well betsy i just want you to know that you can always move into my place and sleep on the couch anytime you want totally rent free too to which she coyly responded awww yeah i could cook and clean at the very least too get the apartment clean for ya aw thanks so much guyssss betsy knew damn well that i was trying to sleep nor was i involved in any way in this conversation so she addressed me in there when she knew or thought that i wasnt listening why did she address me if i had no context as to what the f they were even talking about when i was in the restroom even worse was my bfs response when she offered to cook and clean he replied enthusiastically with a yeah of course wow i dont know how you have time to do all that cleaning though you really know how to prioritize like um helllooooooo im right fg here like next to you i felt like he was somehow for some reason intentionally trying to p me off we have never had problems in pur relationship i always tell him to be open with me and yet he always tells me that he would be and that theres nothing ive ever done that has annoyed him and that he loves me for who i am and treasures every th ing about our relationship hes so sweet but hes just so dumb so they subtly changed the topic after i stirred later in bed that night i was next to my boyfriend crying my eyes out and i asked him right then and there if he was planning on consulting me before just inviting someone to come live with us someone who i reminded him we had a problem with in the pasthe said ohwell i sounded like i was offering it to her but i wasnt really offering babehonestly i dont know why i said it i think i just wanted to say it to be nice and plus she has support she has friends who will help her but im not gonna let her go homeless if she does lose everything shes gonna have a roof over her head and i asked him what the actual hell was going on especially with the cooking and cleaning comment and also that i knew nothing about her hardships prior to their convo why he didnt run it by me why no context was given that he and i were planning on building our own future in his homestead and i said that however much i admired him for his giving nature he couldve offered help and consolation to her in other ways rather than giving her an empty offer that he admitted he couldnt fulfill and dividing his loyalties he is not the kind of person to break promises so i dont think he was being honest with me when he said he offered it to her only because he felt sorry for her i also let him know that he was putting me in a stressful confusing situation with a possibly very strange dynamic that i did not feel comfortable with regardless she somehow made her problems his problems and imposed herself into our lives so thereby that makes her a threat it made me feel as though he werent serious about me at all it was a dealbreaker to me but i didnt verbalize that after i expressed to him how hurt i felt that he didnt even consult me first he said in a slightly sarcastically and patronizingly which is sooo different for him and just told me that he still was not understanding nor valuing my input or my comfort levels with this nor the fact that i had almost been homeless many times in my life and he knew that i was not comfortable having any more roommates as i have been in roommate situations for the past 5 years and he knows im trying to get out of that him oh ok well im sorry for being a giving person to a friend in need gosh and yea she told me she was having money issues when you were in the bathroom why are you making this such a big deal thats when i went from calm to livid and i knew this girl was up to no good thankfully he did seem to understand later after i let him know and i had remained very calm somehow and he was very apologetic and we made up after a lot of discussion and i know he technically didnt do anything wrong but i dont feel as though he can even protect me from situations like this in the future he cant even mention having to run it by his girlfriend whom his loyalty is with when this manipulative b has him wrapped around her finger even when his girlfriend is present so honestly why would i continue it doesnt matter how pure or innocent his intentions were butdoes it i then said i didnt feel like he and i were ready to move in together i had to end up texting her myself and i let her have it i explained my disappointment in what was said between both of them and i then explained my boundaries to her and that i felt disrespected i let him tell her his boundaries and whether or not he ever will tell her is completely up to him since he clearly didnt do it last time like i hoped he would he just encourages her because she strokes his ego and it makes him feel good within these texts to her i reminded her of something unspoken but widely practiced called lady code to which she replied like the narcissist that she is in summation she replied to my valid concern with a copout excuse for her behavior and a textbook narcissist response oh hey girl about the cooking and cleaning thats just my humor and um honestly i have bigger fish to fry and cant let myself be bothered with your trivial schoolgirlage worries im 35 sweetie and no im not going to apologize for any confusion i may have caused but no i have no intention of moving in with any couples my reply yes honey i agree im too old for trivial stuff like this too and your meaning ahem excuse for what you said is just not what i took away from the exchange youre changing your tune now all you couldve said was no thanksto his offer if you didnt have ulterior motives what you lack is respect for boundaries and for women and their relationships i dont know what your intentions are but honey trust and believe that i dont trust you as far as i can throw you and i definitely dont trust you around my boyfriend he never wouldve not consulted me about something like this had you not somehow worked him and clouded his judgement christian you say yeah lord forgive me if im wrong but im getting very opposite vibes from you honey i caught every slight you threw at me and now around you my guard will be up and it will stand as tall as highclere castle if we have the misfortune of crossing paths again oh and the bf and i are quite happy love bye i hold myself to higher standards than this guys this was exhausting i know i hope someones at least entertained at this point i dont know what to do because at the end of the day i cant unhear what i heard in that car no matter how lightly they meant it but i told my boyfriend what she said in response to my text her shady narcissistic response and he now knows that im not taking her or his ht but im honestly wondering now if my bf is so easily entranced by women like this dayum i mean thats just bad i can spot women like this a mile away can i even trust him to not fall into their manipulative mind traps in the future i just dont know if im ready to go on at this point and i want to love him but im just losing the respect i once had for himi thought he was smarter than this tldr im thinking i need to break things off with my boyfriend because of some dumb thing he said to his female friend in front of me and how easily he panders to people he doesnt know very well i have a problem with his narcissistic female friend and feel disrespected but he technically didnt do anything wrong i am just losing what i once felt for him though is this bad enough to end a relationship,0

i have a teacher crush and he knows it we have a newly graduate pe and arts teacher in the start of the year and he is smokin hawt a lot of girls had their eyes on him but as time passed they all just saw him as the good looking teacher but it was different for me im scared that maybe i have this obsession but i really hope its just a teenage teacher crush thatll soon pass im not too discrete about my crush on him with my friends because its just a crush and its illegal to have a teacherxstudent relationship anyway and i have my limits lol soon enough he also knew about it my whole class teased me during his class and even other teachers that im close with joined in too it didnt bother me though im actually amazed from their response but because of that i got super shy around him and sometimes would completely ignore him when we walk past each other i just simply slip in a short good morning there are times where i lose all my shame and full on show him that i do have a crush on him hahahaha but ofc i regret doing it right after there was this recent event in our school and i gathered the courage to ask him for a picture and i did i was really happy about it and would keep looking at the picture whenever i took hold of my phone he even put his arm around my shoulder sjsksjsksjsksksk i died that day christmas party came and i gave him a gift it was a blue shirt and asked him for a picture before 2018 ends after giving him the gift he held his hand up and i was expecting for a high five so i raised mine and oh god he held my hand so tight and just swung it back forth he was looking into my eyes and said thank you with the biggest smile i ever saw he had my friends giggled and goddamn that man knows his effect on me after bidding goodbye i was so hung up on that moment i think i drooled while rewatching the things that happened in my head i went home with a happy heart that day it was 3 minutes before christmas and i was thinking hard on what message should i send him when the clock hit 1201am i just went with the simple merry christmas and continued to message my other friends and greet my family after a hard night i woke up to his message saying merry christmas my naaaaame and damn what a christmas morning i had we chatted for a couple of minutes after that and as soon as our conversation ended i told my friends about it they were so excited for me hahaha anyways thank you so much for reading this long ass post i just wanted to share it with yall this year has been great and i hope yours was too btw he has a girlfriend so ill just put my love for him at the side and admire him as his student whats annoying is that he is such a flirt because he knows i have a crush on him and continues on posting pictures with his girlfriend ugh my highschool student heart hahahaha i respect him his girlfriend tho thank you again for reading and tell me what you think,0

kindness still exists in the world i live in a largeish city i waited too long to remove the snow around my car street parking and basically everything froze into ice blocks around my car i couldnt even open the driver side door i had to crawl in from the passenger side i was hacking away at the ice with my handheld scraper and a very nice young man early 20s maybe came up to me after parking his car and asked if i needed help i said its not a big deal and he still offered to help break up the ice with his metal shovel he had in his car so i stood aside while he cleared the ice and i crawled back in and tried to move the car after maybe 23 attempts at this the ice broke up enough for me to maneuver my car out of the enclosed ice box space that was on the street i rolled down the window and thanked him again and he said well i just know that if it was me trying to clear my car id want someone to help me have a good night to all of those unsung heroes who do things like this out of kindness it makes a big difference,0

i had my first kiss with someone who hates me we are both female and we were 12 lets call her a she had been distant toward me for a few months before this event which was in swimming class st school she had stopped attending choir lessions telling me that she is no good and wants to draw instead we used to hang out nearly every single day and had a whole fantasy playworld we held hands and i suppose we were the types to lay in the grass together too i never thought of kissing her however to me she were the most amazing talented and prettiest person alive i was into boys at 11 and i hit puberty pretty hard alone none of the other girls were quite there yet im highly functional autisticaspergers and didnt know at the time i moved to the country from the city a was my classmate and we clicked within minutes our main teacher was also a freelance choir teacher and we would be her favorites before and after school we had this teacher for only a couple of years i have long blonde hair and have always liked ti wear dresses quite feminine but practical i was very innocent and naive and my parents beleived in being the better person never standing up for yourself but instead explain and accept that they who wish to harm you probably have it worse in life than you were not religious when at school i would wear french romantic dresses my grandparents bought me im very beloved and protected by them they still see me as a child and are stuck in that timesaying it was their best years when me and my sis were children at school i was told frequently we dont wear clothes like that here i didnt really care i told them thats their opinion but personally i liked it all of a sudden a belonged to the popular girls and they would start to subtly poke at my confidence i was pretty confident noone could make me cry etc at the time i was slim but got pretty obvious curves and that was not in back then the days of the miss sixty trousers it got worse a asked me playfully to keep a secret and duck under water with her and she gave me a long normal kiss i broke the secret by thinking it was a prank and was told i was lying after the kiss she slowly became cold toward me im thinking it may not have been a prank she would never be at home anymore or feel poorly and sent her mom to lie to me at the door meeting her outside with my bike was our normal hangout i gave up after 3 weeks the girls would stop inviting me to things and one day my birthday came and noone showed i didnt invite the while class but it destroyed me i had prepared cakes and activites with my mom i didnt confront them about it but would instead be their awkward pet i used these years to build social skills by testing out social bounderies and social rules i needs to understand the patterns other kids would bore me so i never befriended anyone i didntt think of this as a strategy but it definatly did more harm than good the only life i had was the creative after school and lots of family time which was enough to keep me kinda sane or so i thought i got a tiny bit chubby which finally gave one of the now clearly bullies l of the girl group to have something to really comment at ive battled bulimia because this bit have won over it and the memory of ls smug face makes my blond boil l was even chubby herself the whole class of 199 would now turn on me ive been beaten and spat on by the boys to this day i dont understand why i hit back once but got scared of how strong i was i wanted to escape the country tante as now my goal i spent the nest two schools pretty much alone some would call themselfes my firends but i felt numb and no connection and developed anxiety my talent got kinda wasted i lost the confidence i needed in high school a would compliment me after singingguitar perforences and at graduation a figured although we never ever talked that i would move back to the city she was right she gave a very very long and tight hug i was confused ironically we now live in the same city she moved here a few years after me and im terrified of bumping into her im not very good at hate and i dontt hate her im an adult now but all of this still haunts me to this day im working on myself and am much stronger with a good life and social circle i still struggle with trust and the part about people liking me or not is now forever lost so i connect being invited as being accepted after failed birthdays in childhood and teens yes i tried again thanks mom ive never dared to host one today i still obsurdely feel that noone would show up i havent proofread as this is painful stuff so i hope its understandable english isnt my first language it might be a big ol mess im open to explaining in the comments thank you if you read all this none of my friends can work this one out why did a ditch me and why did she initiate that kiss i have no idea what all of it all means maybe someone has an opinion or a similar experience,0

considering suicide im just so empty and so exhausted the last 3 and a half years ive suffered from chronic tmjd where ive had headaches facial pain ear problems like a blown out speaker sensation with loud music and sounds face sensitivity and just feeling hopeless before this i was in the best period of my life where i was working had friends and was super super happy in the last 3 years as ive gone to appointments tried medications and been in pain and sad ive developed severe anxiety and depression to the point where my life is getting smaller and smaller the pain makes me anxious which then makes me depressed then when the pain is easier my anxiety will be bad and will stop me from doing things i never had anxiety like this before my tmj issues flared up i thought things were going to be so much better just over 3 months ago i had surgery on my jaw to hopefully rectify the problem i had both discs in my jaw stitched back and my wisdom teeth taken out on all 4 sides i was praying when i woke up from the surgery that there would be no more crackling when i swallow or no more damaged hearing i was told the pain would take a while but the ear symptoms should go immediately lying in my hospital bed after the surgery and all the symptoms still being there crushed me but i was being positive i remember the night before the surgery lying in bed thinking i felt good mentally no anxiety no depression just hopeful about the future i knew it was a risk go well and everything is back to myself go badly and id sink lower than ever ever since the surgery ive been a wreck i collapsed a day later and was rushed to hospital i was fully conscious but just felt completely vacant and spaced out this was absolutely terrifying and they put it down to the heavy pain drugs i was on that makes people feel a little loopy since then its been anxiety attacks all the time depression and just feeling unlike myself these panic attacks are horrendous i feel spacey headed and my mind convinces me im crazy i cant stop shaking pacing and cant switch my negative thoughts off i was suicidal pretty much every day before this surgery because of the pain and the situation and i think knowing all that had to happen was the symptoms to go and i was myself again just crushes me more now in in a deeper hole with my pain depression and now severe anxiety my suicidal thoughts are overwhelming but i keep going for my mum and my girlfriend i honestly just want my old life back before this like i said i was so so happy new job new friends i was making something of my life and then this hits me i feel trapped like i cant move forward i have a good day anxiety wise or depression wise i feel happy but then go to bed crushingly sad because i know my pains and symptoms havent gone so im still stuck i just feel totally totally hopeless thank you to whoever reads this,1

everybody listen up lgbtq community especially last night my car was vandalized one of the things that was done was honk if your gay ik its youre but they wrote your was written on the back of my windshield last night it completely wrecked me as i have been through alot recently and the fact that someone dislikes me enough to come find my car which everyone in my life knows is extremely valuable to me and vandalize it kinda sent me over the edge however as i drove to work this morning so so many people were honking driving by and smiling i was getting waves and even this big ass semi truck honked his horn a few times which scared tf outta me tbh because i forgot the words were on the back of my window and i thought i was about to get hit by a semi hahhh the point im trying to make is i would never have thought there would be that many people so supportive of the gay community in my area and that got me thinking that alot of you struggling with your sexuality probably feel the same way and probably feel like theres not alot of people in your daily life that would love and support you if they knew today taught me a very valuable lesson that no matter how alone you feel or what youre struggling with theres support out there and people who know exactly what youre dealing with you are all loved and anything and everything you need including love and support is out there for you none of you are ever alone,0

tifu by underestimating the power of a common zit so today i woke up as usual walked up to my bedroom mirror and looking back at me was the biggest evilest and the reddest looking zit i had ever seen in my life as a guy it shouldnt have bothered me so much but you see im not the usual guy and i dont usually get zits or pimples whatever you calk them time for a flashback when i was in school i barely had any friends almost all the kids were into sports and i was a bit overweight and hence didnt mix up very well with everyone so over the years i worked really hard to get into shape and make friends and now im in college back to present all i could think of was that this zit was gonna destroy everything i had worked so hard for also today was an important day as i was going to be working on a project with my crush first i asked for a solution in raskreddit which didnt work out so well cuz the only thing i had was the toothpaste and the remaining stuff out of my budget so i did the the most fucked up thing i took a cloth and i smashed it at first all the blood came pouring out followed buy the wet watery stuff i removed the cloth to see the damage my life was done if u wanna know what it looked like take some toothpaste put it on a table gently press with your thumb halfway the lift it up so it forms a valley in case of my face it was a valley of blood i panicked and did the next big mistake applied my aftershave lotion which transformed the valley of blood into a raging volcano tldr i got a zit i panicked i burst it it looks ugly af i apply lotion on it it burns like hell i finally give up on fixing the damage and decide to take the day off or at least till it gets fixed and the teacher changed my project partner to some weeb edit fixed some of my english,0

feeling really low todayits the perfect storm i suppose last night deciding whether or not to go no contact with an ex and learned an uncle was dying i tried to take the high road and was ultimately disappointed its so hard to make that clean break even if he is a bit of a cnt i hate that when i try to live my convictions i end up getting burned trying to be a big fan of the high road being open fair and honest are important to me as well as not getting into the muckbut im a slow ass learner when it comes to others and what they are willing to do to someone else out of cowardice or selfishness then there have been the deaths around me a beloved teacher and now im just waiting for the call saying that my uncle has decided to leave hospice has it down to hours im a caretaker which is absolutely totally a strain on my mental health but its family so im compelled to do my duty i woke up this morning feeling run over i still had to do the minimums and while i was driving home i felt compelled to just jerk the wheel and end it its been awhile since my urges have presented so aggressively and urgently the what does it even matter urges and questions flooded in obviously i didnt do it and im home but it scared me and it scares me that its lingering so strongly im going to start accessing my mental health toolbox try to take a high road for myself and to try to mellow out but i just needed to vent it out good luck everyone else going through their version of this shit all the love,1
how do i 20f say im not comfortable with my boyfriends 25m trip without coming across as controlling long read so thanks to anyone who reads the whole thing but tldr at the end as always so a bit of backstory to explain why im so nervous about how i sound a few months ago i found out that my boyfriend of 3 years was writing and allowing one of his friends to say horrible things about me we fought about it to this day our only major fight and he claimed he was just venting we ended up seeing a couples therapist together whom we still see today but one of the main things his friend would say was that i was stupid and controlling for example i booked a couples massage with the bonus id gotten from work i originally was going to buy myself a new dress id really liked but he had been complaining about how sore he was after work and i simply didnt have the strength or energy to give a massage that would genuinely help him id try but after half an hour id be left feeling drained and sore and hed be no better off himself making it feel pointless so i thought id surprise him by spending the money on something we could do together and actually benefit him this was taken as a stupid waste of money as you could save the money and just do it for each other at home like i hadnt tried then it was also controlling because i just assumed hed be free that saturday i live with the guy he has the same schedule every monday through friday and always has weekends off so yeah i assumed hed be free because he never mentioned doing anything if he was busy which he wasnt i wouldve happily rescheduled all this to say that even though we are talking and doing a lot better now i still get worried about being called controlling when its more anxiety and just uncomfortable with circumstances im not saying no i just wish we could talk more a few weeks ago he sprung up about how his boss invited him to a baseball game the next evening im a huuuuuge baseball fan he is not but enjoys the beer so its a win for him i was jealous but excited for him until he mentioned that he wouldnt be coming home at all that night i asked what he was going to do he told me he planned to sleep over at his bosses house with the rest of the coworkers who were also invited his boss lives right down the street like we are on a dead end road you have to pass our apartment to get to his bosses place i asked if he could simply be dropped off but he denied i immediately clammed up it was barely any notice and while i figured hed be back late he wasnt going to come home at all he wouldnt let me push it any farther and while i was upset out of fear of sounding bossy i just let it go i hated it though he said he was heading to the game straight after work so he wasnt even going to swing by home to shower or change just gone for 2436 hours saying if he also didnt come home in the morning before going to work his boss got the game tickets for a tuesday night it was a dumb move he did end up coming home around 2 or 3 am which made me feel a bit better but man oh man did i hate going to bed that night under the impression that he was just not coming home i felt like we hadnt talked about it much but im not sure what else there wouldve been to say now comes the problem that brought me to today he came home yesterday after work and informed me that he was most likely going out of town june 1st aka just over a week from now i asked him what for and he said there was a fair going on in a town a couple hours away for machine and 3d printing enthusiasts my boyfriend mind you is insanely smart i call him a sims character because he basically swallows information when it comes to anything computermachinetech anything so when his buddy opened up a side business for 3d printing my boyfriend didnt just latch on to the idea he ended up learning how to code the programs in python over the course of a few days and is now basically a partner in his friends business which means it would be a fantastic opportunity for them to go i was really excited and happy for him but i still wanted a little more information i asked if he was just planning on sharing a room with his friend oh no way id be getting my own room its really close to a beach too so after the booth hours are done we could go hang out there too like a mini vacation mind you more than once weve talked about going out of town to do a mini vacation ourselves so i perked up at this we im invited too oh no its just gonna be me sam and jack not real names obviously oh well if youre going to be getting a separate room anyways would it be okay if i came along if i got the days off of work you know ive been dying to get out of the apartment and the beach would be amazing i work across the street from where we live outside grocery shopping we dont get out much so truly any chance to escape the apartment is a welcomed joy no i dont think so he wouldnt elaborate much more past that okay i admit i was bummed and when i found out the trip is going to be the entire weekend it left me feeling icky but again i dont want to be controlling so im trying to let it go bf texts me today saying the trip might actually be off when i ask why he says that the rooms are actually very expensive while part of me i admit was a little happy he wasnt going to be suddenly gone the whole weekend i knew how badly he had wanted to go so i suggested he look around at close hotels that might be cheaper saying that sam could just pick him up on the way to the convention thing no response for a while then i get this text trips one i guess sam is bringing mary sams wife the kid and his parents mary suggested i just share the room lmao how do i explain how that made me feel so now its gone from three guys road tripping down in a car that cant fit me too to sam his wife his child his parents you and jack and now youre all going to share a room how does that work sam and his wife would most likely have a bed saying its a double room means his parents most likely have the other bed then the kids and jack have to figure something out but so do you now and this is most likely meaning that there are multiple cars involved so how am i still not allowed to come with id love to support my bf at the convention its amazing watching him do something that excites him as usually hes a more blaze kind of guy he lights up when hes doing something he likes plus again im itching to get out the house and he doesnt seem to get that him going on and on about enjoying the relaxing beach without me is like salt on the wound yes im happy for him but it will suck being told by your so how nice the beach is while youre stuck on the couch at home when really theres no reason to be i dunno do i sound controlling or bad am i unreasonable to feel the way i do i dont like having these events just sprung up on me and it hurts that i feel like im being pushy over something that i feel like should be a genuine conversation it was one thing when it was 3 guys in a little electric car going on a road trip i might not like it and might be jealous but he had a point it would be a bit cramped but now its sam and his family billy and him and i feel like me tagging along wouldnt be that big of a deal but he doesnt see the point in talking about it also just for the record ive been told before that people think hes cheating on me i can assure you hes not he has never been one to cheat sent a few pictures of himself at the game with his buddies and to top it off that was one of the main reasons i hated his friend so much she was trying to convince him to lie and say he cheated on me so that i wouldnt want him anymore it was a whole thing so i have complete trust that hes not cheating on me but i do feel like he has a general disregard to my anxiety and feelings i know its not fair to say i have separation anxiety so he cant leave me which is why ive never asked him to stop or stay when i want that more than anything i try to keep myself in check and when he wants to go out with friends once in a blue moon hes a home body hence why we are always inside the apartment i highly encourage it i just wish hed understand springing plans on me like this and not understanding why id like to come hurts me if i had more warning or more understanding id feel a lot better but i dont know how to open that conversation back up without sounding controlling my big fear i should add the main reason i hate the timing so much is not only does that give me a weeks notice but on the 30th we have an obgyn appointment 21 weeks along at that point and the 31st we have our next therapy session so two major events that id like some time to discuss after about but hell be out the door for 3 days out of town and essentially unreachable as hell be busy with the booth and beach anxiety through the roof or maybe its not anxiety but that heavy chest feeling that makes me feel like i might cry but cant really explain i have no idea ugggh so reddit sorry for the insanely long read but what can i do what do you think any advice or thoughts on my situation would be appreciated i am trying my best to be a good girlfriend but i dont know what else i can do here i feel like im crazy so im trying to be as reasonable as possible but im still uncomfortable and want more communication i guess but i dont know how to achieve it at this point in the conversation help tldr boyfriend wants to go on spontaneous trip out of town without any warning and im seemingly uninvited despite everyone else whos getting to go this isnt the first time its happened but i dont know how to talk to him about it and how it makes me feel a little uncomfortable without coming across as controlling a major fear of mine from previous circumstances i just want to open up that line of communication but i dont know how help,0

we should make a logographic writing system with emojis it would have no spoken or signed equivalent and it would be universal basically to maximize what we can say in the least amount of characters and have a written language we can all understand each emoji couldnt represent a phonetic sound cuz there would be no spoken equivalent but combinations of different emojis could mean different things so would just mean canada but something like idk could mean north america or something and from canada to mexico like could mean thing 1 through thing 2 like thing 2thing 1 and could mean thing 1 to thing 2 like thing 1thing 2 idk im putting this idea into the world so someone else will do it i wouldnt know where to start,0

lost a co worker to suicide she was actually a friend we wernt close but i definetly consider her a friend when my other friend from work told me yesterday he called her a stupid bitch it mad me mad and sad cause we didnt know her struggles nor did any of us know her pain i think its wrong to pass any judgement i hope she is at peace i have empathy for her cause suicide has come up a lot in my life but i also hope all her family and friends can heal from her loss i feel bad but i also understand how it feels like you have no way out i hope this is not in any way offensive to anyone like i said everyones pain and struggles are different rip my friend,1
vent club im 32f hes 35m for the first two years we were together sex was kind of bad hed finish within two minutes max and id have to finish by myself masturbate did that for almost two whole years i took the pipe and the load and got left high and dry i asked one day why he didnt care if i went too and he said i cant help it youre tight i cant last sometimes itd improve but would always go back to the way it was then i meet a girl i didnt know she was attracted to me until the day she made her move she didnt want anything from me sexually she just wanted to go down on me we are drinking and smoking i was f a d e d she kisses me and i kissed her i had never kissed a girl before sorry i didnt like it i couldnt bring myself to kiss her again mainly because of how aggressive she was being she puts her hand down my blue jean shorts and tries to stimulate me also by kissing on my neck ears shoulders etc you know when youre so drunk you feel that dangerous spin that comes from deep inside when youre sitting still yeah that was me i was aware of that mouthwater thing that happens before vomit her boyfriend busts through the door naked short and covered in body hair like hes going to hop in and get in on it he repulsed me when i was sober my mouth fills with vomit and i accidentally get some spew on their bed and myself i hurry to the bathroom and finish throwing up i clean up and come out and these two were actually having sex near my vomit i leave and from then to today learned to deal with my husbands short comings no he cant last longer then two minutes max but at least hes not degenerate i didnt tell him until three years later during an existential crisis a full blown mental breakdown october last year now 6 yrs total i am obviously in the wrong for doing all that now our relationship is struggling i love him so much to a fault im not trying to lose him i want to deal with the situation but he is a man and talking about relationships is not a favorite pastime for them and im a woman im going to see odd behavior and rationalize it by jumping to baseless conclusions is he cheating will he revenge cheat hes spiteful sometimes not to mention he gets angry if i look at his phone and ask questions about who is who and what is what i have been suspicious of him liking men since he made no effort to try foreplay and rejects oral activities plus some other oddities like questioning him hes a guilty quiet and doesnt deny or confirm homosexuality outright at first he will eventually say hes not gay but not right away like i assume straight men do i hate to say it but it might even be his boss that hes interested in i started checking his phone and he used a backup sms app he said it was because of his calendar app lies and its easy to tell the app that restores his calendar has a root folder and it wasnt modified on march 6th it was from february 12th when he got his new phone so he never touched it then he accidentally uploaded all his texts to outlook while he was at work but outlook was also signed in at home i didnt read all the texts i thought they were ones i already read but then i think he deleted all texts except for the ones between us and even the outlook accounts themselves he says he doesnt know what happened to the texts or the emails i tell him i can tell hes hiding something specifically one afternoon after days of trying to figure us out i just have to go i guess youre not telling me the truth because youre probably afraid i will kill myself or that i will ruin your life and he said nothing he says its because hes tired of me constantly coming at him in an angry way and that i accuse him of cheating for no reason he makes me feel like im the crazy one obviously this isnt all the info i have much more damning evidence of him being gay but this is already too long am i buggin tldr my husband sucked at sex for two years and i almost cheated didnt even do it now our relationship is struggling and i am starting to believe he is gay anyway any suggestions or opinions am i just deflecting and looking for things because of my own guilt,0

pigeons today i was going to the market close to my house and then lots of pigeons went to the sidewalk and just stayed there walking slowly they didnt even care about my presence and i even murmured excuse me so they could let me pass they were blocking my way its funny because i dont normally talk to animals like snowwhite in the street it was just so casual that it made it funnier and made me happy thats it thats the post haha,0
cant carry on anymore ive literally just made this account because i really dont know what else to do with myself and i need a distraction today was so horrible i feel like my outbursts of anger are getting worse and worse and today was probably the closest ive come to either running away or killing myself everything is going wrong this year already lost my job broke af and my depression ive had since i was 14 has returned 100 times worse than ever ive always contemplated suicide more times than i can count but today i think i actually scared myself in realising that its something im eventually gonna do i snapped at my mom again today this time it ended with her saying dont come here ever again and at the time i dont give a fuck and will happily agree to never see her again but its when i return home and start crying to myself that i need my mom so much and that the whole argument was caused by me i just dont know what to do anymore leaving work has only made me realise how depressed i actually am its rare i come out of bed until its past afternoon the loneliness is creeping in again and i know i have literally no one to turn to now because ive pushed everyone away and im terrified of what i might do sorry ive never posted on here before so i dont know what to do,1
i told my crush that i like her it went correct i know at least she doesnt like me but i managed that we stay friends for now like omg i was so stressed ok ok she doesnt like me but she took the thing quite nicely for now just to evade any awkward situation we decides not to bring that back until one of us do to do short its half a victory sorry if engrish,0
needed to say thisits strange how people act when they know theyre suicidal like if your life is at its worst point personally and you know its just a matter of time before you end it allits not all dramatic you may be dramatic about it or your goingons in the daybut its not at all the thoughts that are dramatic the thoughts are pretty simple its strange because its almost empathetic how do i kill myself with it being the most convenient or least bit intrusive for someone else ill give you an example if i wanted to kill myself lets say in the way that im going to be dramatic about it by trigger warning graphicslashing my wrists id do it but then id have to think about the carpeting upstairs like blood barely comes off clothes easily when theres a huge stain how the hell is it going to get out of the carpet thats a whole upholstery cost and recarpeting the room is just going to be a bitch for whoever thats why you sometimes have to do some creative thinking hey i could do it in the bathtub but then you think man thatsi mean i guess that works but its uncomfortable and you have to drain it and people use that tub to shower you think carpeting costs are high do you know how much it costs to replace a bathtub i dont but i imagine its quite a bit i think it stems from the fact that to be suicidal its not that youre devoid of all emotion youre really empathetic to your own situation in a very selfabsorbed selfaware sympathetic way like the pain and misery that this person feels you feel directly and you wish you could help with the cliche suggested way of things but thats not going to help thats liketrying to wash dishes with dirty dishwater i mean i guess it might clean it but damn its not ideal and why do it just to get the dishes all dirty anyway instead you become empathetic to the all of it the situation but also the thoughts and feelings you understand just as you would standing at the memorial service if youre so lucky to have one of a another fellow of the what are we some kind of suicide squad club you know that feeling of well i meani guess i understand why hed do it what im trying to say is that moment when you think to yourself damn who would want to live like that crosses the feeling of who can ever live like this is where you get the final nail in the coffin of the decision to do it why should i keep living like this the only difference between the suicidal people and the people that decide to move get a hair cut change their outfits and maybe their phone number is thatwell honestly its just too much work meh rather kill myself than have to explain to that older lady at work why i thought itd be a good idea to get frosted tips at 25 the thing is anytime anyone actually goes through with it it really does feel like a loss you feel the potential they had to become someone something big even and thats because the people that do go through with it arent actually lazy people theyre not at all theyre people that can have accomplishments goals aspirations and the motivation and drive to actually achieve them they have before and they prove it to you again with this one final exit of achievement truth is its the failures that cant do it cant go through with it and so desperately wish they could that are lazy unmotivated to achieve anything in life and unwilling to do anything about it to change even if that change involves just ending it so you know there arent going to be any further things to do afterwards man the only thing worse than people that are suicidal are those that are just failures in life like bottom of the barrel trash good people people with goals and the personal means and will to achieve them are the ones we feel sorry for because they can go through with it the guy standing in the crowd feeling sorry for himself wondering when hes next meh who cares call me when you do something about it otherwise fuck off youre just a dramatic hyper aware failure of a human being right now do something about it and then people will notice otherwise shut up swallow some valizoproloft or whatever and join the rest of the world who inevitably have it worse than you from the get go wish i was the first kind but it sucks that being part of that hyper aware crew im at least aware enough to know suicide isnt right for me im just a failure so here i go again for another year or decade thinking that maybe ill do it but inevitably just posting here or something hoping whoever it is will notice and at least for a little while a human connection will be made between us just even for the fact that hey using dirty dishwater to clean your dishes is still something instead of just breaking the dishes all together man i hate doing the dishes,1

wasting each oppurtunity that i had to apologise to her before she died my stubbornness cost me dearly okay here goes my story is from ten years ago my mothers mother my nan had lived with us almost all my life i had always been extremely close to her and i loved her tremendously i didnt get along well with my mother and my nan was always there in her own part of the house for me when i really needed someone she wasnt this image of sweet old grandma baking cookies she was as my dad always described her an old battleaxe she was an amazing person and i spent countless hours in her part of the house as a child ten years ago i was 16 my nan became ill and unable to leave her bedroom her legs became inflamed and swollen and every few days nurses had to come in to wrap new bandages around her legs she became unable to walk even to the toilet but her pride and stubbornness wouldnt let my mom help her after a while her mind started to fade and she would call out at random times of the day yelling about this and that seeimg imaginary creatures and people in her room calling us by the names of her late sisters etc it was hard on us all as a family to deal with we took food to her and kepy her company for as much time as we could spare to sit in that room but tensions were so high my mom was so unhappy and she wanted so desperately for my nan to go into a carehome where nurses would be on hand and she would be assisted to use the toilet and shower etc they argued all the time and i always pitied my nan so much such a proud stubborn woman was now hiding soiled clothes in her bathtub it was horrible i didnt get mad or pissed off at my nan and i helped take her her dinner and i spent a couple nights sleeping in her room when my family were away i enjoyed spending time with her but it wasnt the same anymore she didnt know what day of the week it was despite watching tv each day and having tv magazines she didnt know it went my 17th birthday and my 17 year old self was hurt my mom bought a card and got my nan to sign it but i didnt want it my birthday was the beginning of the end really that was november and come the january my nan was in a sad place mentally shed become so stressed and felt so pressured about going into a carehome she started refusing the dinners we made and became generally more demanding banging on the floor for a cup of tea 30 times a day made my mom so upset one day in january my mom returned home to tell me she had found my cat dead on the road and i was heartbroken she had retrieved his body and i cried and stroked it for hours the next day when taking my nan her food i told her about my cat she was in a bad mood and she said i dont care about a stupid cat we argued then unlike we ever have before she said such nasty things and i said such nasty things back she ridiculed my school situation i was in and out of college unsure what i even wanted to study and i shouted back at her that she hasnt had a life since my grandad died a decade before that shed given up that we only ever wanted to help her and she was ungrateful we shouted back and forth i called her pathetic and she started to cry i turned to leave i remember i felt ready to cry i remember turning and giving her such a nasty look before i stormed down the stairs i never saw her again a week passed since the argument and my mom kept telling me i should apologise to my nan i said no way i was stubborn too i said shed hurt my feelings really badly and i felt so angry at her my mom said it isnt as though nan can walk down the stairs and come to me i didnt care another week passed and my mom told me my nan had asked where i had gone i remember thinking then i miss her i should see her again i didnt go up the stairs i was an stubborn idiot a couple of days later my dad took my nans dinner upstairs and found her dead on her bathroom floor he wouldnt let me and my sister go upstairs and see her i asked him will she be okay he shook his head and whispered i think shes gone it was the worst day of my life i didnt see her body in the house my dad said it was very distressing to see her slumped on the floor i saw them wheel her out the front door under a sheet i saw her body in her coffin a week later her face was all bruised from having hit the sink as she fell her heart had just stopped and shed died in an instant in her coffin i put a piece of paper with the lyrics i had written down of evanescenses song forgive me check out the song if you havent heard it they said everything i wish i had said to her i had regret and guilt so heavy on my heart that it felt suffocating i thought i would never be able to rid myself of the constantly nagging reminder of all those opportunities i had to say sorry it has been ten years now and every memory i have of her is somehow tainted with knowing how she last saw me as cruel and spiteful she loved me for all the years of my life and in the very last time she saw my face it was a nasty scowl directed right at her my story is very long but i suppose the moral of this one is obvious thanks for reading my story its been an incredibly difficult thing that i have had to live with but it gets better i had so many dreams in the years following her death where i would run upstairs and she would be there sitting in her chair id cry and shout im sorry and shed tell me it didnt matter the dreams have faded now and i feel more at peace than i used to i wish everyday i could see her again cherish the people you love tldr i argued with my nan and wasted each oppurtunity i had to apologise to her she died a fortnight later and living with the feelings of guilt and regret have been extremely difficult,0
not checking if i had my credit cards this just happened an hour ago omg i am such an idiot it was epl night so we friends went drinking i was running late as usual reached there and everyone was around 45 drinks down already ordered a pitcher and united were 10 down in the first half im not a united fan making fun of them and chelsea winning etc lots of banter a friend left after an hour since he had a date and two of us were left now this friend started feeling a little weird second pitcher in so i told him to leave get home and sleep both of them paid their bills before leaving and i said ill be fine watching football and finishing my beer the second pitcher was still half full like an idiot i asked for the cheque rather confidently it comes i open my bag and voila i have no wallet only 300 inr and a food card which i havent yet activated i rushed to the washroom and sat for literally 15 minutes thinking about the things the pub guys would make me do if i told them i had no cash 1 theyd make me wash the beer glasses thats okay 2 theyd makes me wash peoples plates ugh but still okay 3 theyd make me sweep and clean the place of cigarette butts etc i finally had the sense to call a friend and ask him to come bail me out with some cash took an hour before he got there and i left as soon as he reached needless to say all the high i achieved went down that toilet pot all because i didnt check my bloody bag before leaving ps just got home and hello my cards were lying on my bed,0

any tips for me 19f on how to approach this guy 18m we work together as counselors at an overnight summer camp and were in the same friend group and were friendly and we joke around and i do think hes super attractive but hes also so quiet most of the time that for awhile i thought he just didnt like me all too much we rarely get one on one time because of short breaks which we all like to spend together as a group and bc of our busy schedules when we do get rare one on one time i get so far up in my own head thinking he doesnt like me that the quiet just lasts longer weve had a couple days break over the fourth of july to go home and decompress before another round of campers came in and it was really nice but i also missed my camp family a lot considering many of us grew up together as campers and now work on staff earlier this evening i got a snap from him saying miss you i said i missed him too and that i was ready to come back from break and see everyone i know this is a silly question but where do i go from here ive always hated this game of do they like me or dont they its absolutely killer to my anxiety and in most of my past relationships ive never been the one to initiate things it takes a lot out of me to do so and i always feel as if im doing it wrong does anyone have any suggestions on how to ease these nerves and approach something like this the right way tldr guy i work with at a summer camp is cute i get really bad nerves trying to initiate anything and advice on how to do it properly and deal with these nerves would be really appreciated,0
sad written thingsi keep a digital journal just in case i randomly die i need people to know that i was not ok and that im still not ok explantion time i am a sad individual as a kid my parents would only give their praze to my older sibling they would talk about how great she was to everyone while i ment nothing to them i would sit on the side lines while they would talk about how pretty and smart she was i grew up thinking i was ugly yeah tough times one time my dad out right told me to get up of the couch and give it to my sister cuz she was a girl my dads abit of a sexist or maybe its cuz i knew about his porn collection still it was abundantly clear to me that i was the least loved in the family i always tought about killing myself but i never had the balls to try it out or did i dun dun dunnn on the subject of balls n shit my mom once said i should wear a dress and no it wasnt even this nice but i dont really want to explain my whole life at one point my mom didnt consider that i was her son just because i implied that she had a boy friend at a family reunion at that point i already felt like a strange in my own family so i distanced myself from them a couple of months ago i drank some detergent as a means to end it all and suprice suprice im not dead but at the same time i really did fuck up my throut never talked to them about it i realised some thing that day and that was that i was scared to die and that im not gonna kill myself btw drinking chemicals is never a good way to go trust me if u think i should see a therapist i cant afford it i cant explain all this to my disfunctional family im doing honestly better but i need people to know that shit like this happens maybe even worse all i know is that having a journal is a greaf way to release stress especially in a case like mine on that note do u all ever wonder how people would feel if you were to one day die and realise how much pain they caused cuz i think about that alot and i find peace in the fact they will suffer on the inside for what theyve done i might sond like an asshole but im being truthful thus this post if u made it to the end of this post may you live a long and some what peaceful life cuz death shouldnt be anyones cup of tea i might have just insulted a couple of people guys that wear dresses sorry its just that it hurts when your parents do you dirty like that,1

squirting on an old lady on the metro this happened a few days ago but i didnt get the chance to post it until now my friends and i were looking for fun things to do around shanghai and one of the easiest forms of travel in shanghai is the metro after meeting up at a station we got on a train headed towards a tourist stop and sat down my friends had eaten breakfast beforehand but they were nice enough to brought me a few shanghai breakfast items one of them being xiaolongbao soup dumplings however at that moment i had forgotten that there was soup in the dumpling i was eating so as soon as i bit into the first dumpling the hot juice that was trapped inside came bursting out like a doughy pimple right onto the elderly lady who was sitting in the seat right in front of me after what seemed like minutes of eyewatering embarassing eyecontact i dug out a packet of napkins and wiped off her leg shamefully returning the rest of my breakfast to its bag for later consumption tldr be careful what you put in your mouth in public,0

im just so miserable that its honestly funny i totally feel so much like shit right now ngl it all makes sense nowive been feeling this dormant pain inside of me every day i came to accept it only to experience the pain becoming more severe and acute but its alright i can withstand it i can take it all but do you honestly know what is it that i cant take anymore being a disappointment to people who i do my best for being a good for nothing even though i put in all my effort and might into everything i do making people grow tired of me making people wait even when i do all the work to be on time making sacrifices for the people i love only to be taken for granted in return trying my best to make them happy even if im not happy putting so much effort and still be unnoticed what i dont comprehend is why do i get to feel this way even though all i do is trying to never do wrong for anyone or anything lets speak reality though all of the above was caused by me i have brought it all upon myself i never blamed anyone nor i do blame anyone because this is one hundred percent me my life and whats become of it or it might just be my mental health speaking at this point ive got a side of me which has sever depression anxiety a self destructive trait trauma and i dont even know what else do i have but yeah a damaged shitty mental health whatever it is all i know is that i need to die i really wish that i was able to donate my life to someone who actually deserves living rather than being wasted on something like me but thats just wishful thinking so yeah after all we are all dying its the natural process of life its just a matter of time being sooner or later so me taking my leave earlier isnt a bad thing afterall,1
blowing out a candle alright so this actually happened about an hour ago and i ended up getting to where i needed to be and the redness seems to be going away i still taste and smell it though so today my family was getting ready to go to a gathering of sorts and i decided to put on my nice clothes i have a fair few shirts but i decided to pick one of the more expensive ones i got everything on and my mother told me to snuff out the candle we left burning on the dinner table to freshen the area up before we leave and this is where i forget how things work i pick up the candles jar and realize this jar is a bit deep so i cant use my fingers like i normally do so i turn it towards myself and i blow of course me being a complete fucking bean blows too hard not just a little too hard but like with a force that could make compressed air cans blush yes im bragging about my ability to blow so now this is where i realize that im a complete fucking onion im suddenly blinded both by wax splattering onto my glasses and into my eyes and more of the hot sticky liquid gets all over my face so in a panic as i tilted the jar i spill even more onto my shirt so after i settle down and head to the washroom to clean it off i realize im a complete fucking brick i had waited for too long and it had all dried up at this point everyone else was just about ready to leave brother was in the car waiting and we were already pushing into late territory because my sister in law was getting ready i spent a fair bit of time cleaning myself up lamenting over my shirt picking dried candle wax from everywhere and panicking about the redness the hot wax left behind on my face a fair bit had gotten into my mouth and the back of my throat and dried up so i rinsed my mouth several times to rid my mouth of the taste but even now i can smell cinnamon orange spice i change shirts and end up making everyone about twenty minutes late tldr blew too hard on candle got wax on self and shirt made family late to event because of cleanup,0

friendly information what are antitrust laws and anticompetition practices in video games ive been noticing some discussions again and again that might have these three terms antitrust anticompetition anticonsumer obviously everyones entitled to an opinion but opinions are opinions they are different from facts so lets discuss facts in this happy friendly tip antitrust laws antitrust lawsurl have a broad and almost archaic definition nowadays heck the first such law the sherman law was enacted in 1890 for crying out loud there have of course been additional laws and amendments including the creation of the federal trade commission or ftc more on this later in laymans terms antitrust laws are designed to protect consumers from abuses of monopolies or unfair methods of competition there are a handful of major antitrust lawsuits one big example in tech was the us government versus microsoft yes that microsoft back in the 90s microsoft was accused of having a monopoly on the browser market when they were bundling internet explorer along with windows well it turns out that was a nono because competitors such as netscape would be hardpressed to become an option as a browser microsoft actually lost this caseurl and the original ruling was to break it up into two companies one to develop the os and the other to create additional software microsoft eventually appealed and the rest is history but that was the 90s some recent examples from the eu which is notably more aggressive in its handling of antitrustanticompetition issues would be the eus multiple fines levied on googleurl due to its abuse of its market share via android as well as when its own search engine unfairly favored its own services the eus complaint just this april 2019 was regarding geoblocked keysurl as a violation of antitrust laws named in the eus investigation were five game publishers bandai namco capcom koch media focus home and zenimax and one storefront steam surprised eh zoinks anticompetition while antitrust laws are the laws themselves anticompetition is simply the practice or activity that could cause a violation of those laws what does this have to do with video games well theres a good chance you mightve seen a random user who says exclusives are anticompetition but is this user correct q whats the stance of the federal trade commission a check it out hereurl q wtf does that even mean a exclusive contracts can benefit competition in the market by ensuring supply sources or sales outlets reducing contracting costs or creating dealer loyalty as discussed in the fact sheets on dealings in the supply chain exclusive contracts between manufacturers and suppliers or between manufacturers and dealers are generally lawful because they improve competition among the brands of different manufacturers interbrand competition however when the firm using exclusive contracts is a monopolist the focus shifts to whether those contracts impede efforts of new firms to break into the market or of smaller existing firms to expand their presence the monopolist might try to impede the entry or expansion of new competitors because that competition would erode its market position the antitrust laws condemn certain actions of a monopolist that keep rivals out of the market or prevent new products from reaching consumers the potential for harm to competition from exclusive contracts increases with 1 the length of the contract term 2 the more outlets or sources covered and 3 the fewer alternative outlets or sources not covered q seriously wtf jason a it means that exclusives themselves are not anticompetition by nature in fact exclusive agreements in general are a healthy form of competition i know right mind blown it also requires a certain factor a monopolisturl and by definition a monopolist is one that has a large market share the lions share of an industry preventing newcomers from competing it means that a company has to do something drastic that rivals cannot even enter the market or competition can no longer exist fairly exclusive games are by their very nature not anticompetition if that was the case then there should never have been a single console exclusive from a thirdparty developer since the 80s but that wasnt what happened historically right because those exclusives drove and nurtured healthy competition for decades in the eyes of the law q what about aggressive competition nobody likes that right a well actually the law does what the main faq page of the ftcurl free and open markets are the foundation of a vibrant economy aggressive competition among sellers in an open marketplace gives consumers both individuals and businesses the benefits of lower prices higher quality products and services more choices and greater innovation what about anticonsumer practices this one is even more broadly defined in general though these are practices that attempt to mislead defraud scam or outright harm a consumer are game exclusives anticonsumer that is debatable but again if that was the case console exclusives wouldve been shut down by now or they should receive a stern talking to from time to time the removal of the option to purchase a certain good from a certain store doesnt necessarily mean the removal of your right to purchase or consume because more than likely another store is there whether you like that store or not the mere fact that you exercise your consumers right to not buy something out of principle as opposed to being misled or harmed implies your capability to decide as a consumer ultimately though this last factor is the only point of contention we are all consumers with different opinions but by that very nature if you like dislike or are impartial about something you are therefore simply protecting your rights as a consumer if someone likes a store or a game thats fair because thats their right as a consumer you should protect that right if you consider yourself proconsumer the same goes for anyone who may dislike the same thing so long as it doesnt actively seek to mislead defraud or harm others in the eyes of the law its fair game why the heck did you write this for one thing there were a couple of big earthquakes here in the philippines and a few aftershocks have been rumbling manila straddles a major fault line as well im just making sure everything is ready in case of an emergency plus i cant sleep since well be watching avengers endgame in the morning and no one wants quakes to happen while in a cinema sigh second and perhaps more importantly its to prevent misinformation or the lack of awareness when it comes to these terms far too often youll see these buzzwords thrown around fun fact you probably havent seen any of these terms until recentlyin recent years when discussing games now rather than using sources like twitter or youtube to learn about these things my advice would be to use your government agencys website instead alternatively check out some transcripts of hearings or ask a lawyer note im not a lawyer i just like reading walls of text otherwise check out business websites or ask expert market analysts last but not least if you do see a user whos throwing these terms around randomly out of the blue then save this topic and link it back to them it may provide insight or it might get them bored either way youre using factual information in a discussion about opinions thanks for reading,0

friendship leading to relationship or just getting stronger tldr is it worth it to compromise a friendship of years to pursue a relationship with someone if it seems like both parties are interested dont really know what else to add here i am 25 m and is a 21 f okay so i met 5 years ago we were both in 45 year relationships with other people that both ended last year mine after hers 8 months ago okay so i met through my ex like they were friends before i even knew her and that was fine the 4 of us s boyfriend of the time would all chill together and go to concerts beach we were all friends not the closest freinds maybe we would see them once a month sometimes longer but we always had a good time anywho fast forward 4 years this past year was insane we all broke up and stopped hanging out but within a month of me and my ex breaking up so 8 months ago my ex and her ex started partying and drinking doing coke which was all pretty wild at the time because i was still freinds with and her ex so huge arguements break out and a couple months pass none of us even live in the same citys anymore so 3 months ago i moved cities as well and moved in with my sister and guess who she lives literally 10 houses away from i had no idea i didnt even know what city she lived in so whatever long story short me and this girl have both been doing the same fun stuff we used to but idk it obviously seems different but i mean it feels really different and we have been seeing each other everyday as freinds she come over to my sisters who we helped clean up her place and mental state together and she stays every night till at least midnight im actually writing this right after she left so my ex and s ex who we are pretty sure are screwin and living together caught wind of this and started accusing us of being in an intimate relationship so this was a month ago and since then weve gotten a hell of a lot closer she touches me all the time laughs at literally any stupid joke i make like idk i dont want to sound basic but all the flirtatious things girls do shes a really shy and awkward girl so the fact im picking it up either means im completely full of myself or shes trying to get me to notice idk so my ex and her got in a arguement a couple days ago and said to my ex after a heated exchange of words maybe i should screw your man and show him how its done and more but im not gonna repeat it so theyre all mad at each other and shows me her phone and the messages and well like she wasnt trying to hide it i calm my ex down and the day passes and i walk home because honestly since my ex even accused me and her of being together ive thought about it so ive been pretty flirty with her too anyways i talk to her about what she said and i say quote even if i did like you enough to do something about it it wouldnt be over revenge of my ex it would be because i genuinely like you as a person and we understand each other so well but these are the exact reasons why i never want to lose you out of my life referring to her staying as a freind so i guess everything would be gung ho but me and decided before all this crap happened we would move into a place together like we made this agreement as freinds and it was a good plan like we both have mediocre jobs and know hardly anyone else in this city idk am i being too worrysome am i being too sensitive towards my ex idk what direction to try to even go into any advice would be great,0

im a compulsive liar and want to die obvious af but trigger warning also extremely long but if you deal with compulsive lying depression being a survivor or self defeating tendencies read if youre able im basically at the point where im trying to get the courage to end it but i figured id reach out if it helps anyone else and share the story that brought me here first off i have a compulsion to lie i cant convince you that this is true but i need to be honest somewhere and i guess an anonymous burner account works youll hate me by the end of this and no doubt wish i was dead too ive been dealing with depression and dysphoria since i was little i was sexually molested by a teachercaretaker while i was at daycare preschool 45 its kind of a blur i was forced to do things to her and other kids she told us if we told that wed get in trouble and our family would be in trouble my father was abusive physical and emotional my depression set in at that young age because i was constantly in crisis probably adrenal fatigue i had always been attracted to men and women and didnt feel safe in my skin i would find out later just a few years ago in fact that im intersex i always felt dysphoria about my body and how i looked felt out of place and disgusting i lied to sound cool to try and be a different person tried to fit in homeschooled but socialized i wasnt as much of an outcast as i thought i was but constantly being dragged down by my own doubt soon i moved out of the house went to college at 15 for highschool completion ended up in an abusive relationship just call her l i left that relationship shortly after for a 10 year one lets call her m that ended when i realized i wasnt happy ever my depression caused issues in that first relationship with l i was about 1617 years old i tried to commit suicide the first time during my long term relationship with m we had issues but nothing terrible at first it was mostly me being sad and having lack of energy i lost jobs stayed in bed struggling constantly feeling like a failure and a disappointment constantly i lied to friends still but had gotten better sometime right before i broke up with m i met someone online that was like a breath of fresh air we went to comiccon and met her and her boyfriend some other folks i confided in her again lets call her d and we hit it off we were both in struggling relationships and she was in an open one we were friends first but flirted a lot i drifted from m we fought more i started cutting and other forms of self harm to top off this period i got a great job and lost it because of my depression soon i was working in a call center d asked me if i wanted to attend another con with her and a friend i agreed taking out a loan to do so m wasnt happy about this because she had a lot of debt which i happily paid off when i had my good job but i would risk everything to make d happy i attended the convention even though ds mutual friend dropped out that meant we were staying in an air bnb alone the first night she confided in me that she felt more than friendship for me and i was starting to feel the same d had asked her boyfriend if she could make out with me since they had an open relationship but he said no she disregarded that and soon we were having everything except kissing we had all kinds of sex minus penetration and engaged in kinks and such that m was not interested in we kissed a lot too eventually like young lovers we said goodbye on our separate ways home once home we continued to sext and even skype she said shed continue to talk her boyfriend maybe he would budge and we could be out and open however i was still with m this is when i told her that i was feeling we needed to split up this is also when i started lying again its also where i became a monster that truly deserved death d told me that her boyfriend had seen our romantic texts and flew off the handle he said she needed to stop one of their major issues was he could bang whoever but she had to check in with him basically we stopped for a bit but she continued to come back to the romantic and sexual stuff i knew in my messed up head we might have a chance so i went along i had been through some serious health issues and d started to confide that she had more kinds of feelings for me we were romantic best friends soul mates after treatment i continued to say that my illness was worse m was heartbroken i had no job not even the terrible one i went to ds state for a job interview where we promptly met and had sex m meanwhile could no doubt see the writing on the wall i didnt get the job but i said i did i couldnt stop myself from lying it began getting worse both women thought i had a job and would be moving to ds state once there i continued looking for a job and had no luck i continued to engage in sexual contact with d and mooching money off of family i felt awful but i truly loved d she said she loved me then one night she told me that her boyfriend had made up with her and that she knew wed never have a legit relationship not openpoly and she wouldnt leave him she told me id probably grow to hate her eventually i was broken this whole time i was on strong psych meds for the first time ever celexa wellbutrin and topimax plus a weight loss drug thats basically speed the phen in phenfen all prescribed of course after d told me she couldnt be with me i started looking for dates in earnest m and i had broken up and now my soul mate was gone i told her i got even sicker so shed stay but she continued having sexual encounters and got distant i met a woman lets call her v this woman was wild scary but in the exciting way soon after our first date we hooked up i told her the same stories i was telling d because i couldnt stop at this point i was sick in my lies and mentally in reality she told me she loved me that second night she looked me in the eyes and said i claim people you know my friend x shes mine and now so are you and it was scary but it felt so very good to be loved i told her i loved her too she started coming over unannounced bringing large amounts of weed which is illegal in their state and i lied lore and said i smoked it which i didnt i had barely been a drinker even up until that point not straight edge but damn if i was going to let go of my faculties d got jealous she knew about me and v because we were still friends at this point we even had full passionate sex the kind that wed been talking about for a while soul connection but with a hit of sadness to come i know now that was probably goodbye sex as soon after on valentines day she came out with the truth to her boyfriend they made up and i tried to kill myself then losing my best friend and lover being scared of v and unsure why i was still so far from home and the woman who loved me m my best friend of ten years i threw away almost everything i had and swallowed a ton of pills i woke up to them puked all over the place i decided it was time to go home i told v my mother was sick because frankly i thought she might hurt me or something i had just attempted suicide and it was raw i needed to leave and the lying was rolling out d wondered why i was leaving so suddenly she began to question my stories about the continued illness money i had given her etc basically everything that could unravel at that point came apart like a walmart rug i lied at first but admitted everything i told her yes when she asked and when questioned as to why i lied i had no answer i could only try to backpedal not knowing the cliff behind me was one id dug myself she swore she hated me and said never contact her again i even admitted to things that were actually true but i couldnt stand to lose her trying to impress had been what got me in this mess feeling no self worth soon i got back to my home state i received a text from v saying she knew my mother was fine now i know d had gone on a rampage telling all of our mutual friends that i was a liar and digging up some she didnt know but she felt she needed to tell them all the same i believe thats how v found out she said i revenge of the nerds raped her she called me every horrible name i just had to agree i hated myself and three people who had loved me had turned to hating me in two months i didnt lie about my heart or who i was but i took what she said and put it inside me even if that isnt rape someone i cared about went through what i did when i was little they felt that hatred i once felt toward the woman at my daycare i got a job almost immediately upon return stayed wit the same family i had used their money to survive i felt awful one night after work i tried meeting up with someone i needed to be assured i wasnt he monster i actual was after her telling me she thought i was lying about something i tried to confide in her that i had been a liar felt awful i had lied to her about having money i didnt have despite her having money just a stupid lie but she wanted nothing to do with me so i checked myself into the hospital after nearly jumping in front of a train what awaited me wasnt mental help or understanding or even the ability to tell anyone they locked me in a cement room with a paper gown and threatened to put me in an institution i got picked up after 72 hours and went home soon after i lost this brand new job with its new lease on life lost my apartment one last romantic encounter i thought i was such scum i decided to treat people nice spend all my money and time to try and get love i met a girl who genuinely was full of life and energy we went home and uhoh basically fell in love after one night of sex you see the pattern of love addiction im sure we had a great first month together i felt like living again truly a good time and i loved her as much as i had m for those first few years lets call her t t and i moved out i got a job spent all of my time energy and money on her but i soon lied about how much money i had i could see he writing on the wall i tried to tell her and be honest but i lied over and over shed ask me about it and i would just confess not sure why i had lied why i was scared to tell her the truth but i was eventually she had got a breaking point i decided i was a monster and needed to just finish what id tried so many times i told her to go to her moms house to leave she called the police despite me wanting to do it after she left she just knew what i was thing to do i was going to drown myself in the bathtub with sleeping pills in my system or finally jump in front of that train but instead the police showed up shoved me into cuffs and i spent another three days in a concrete room i was planning on leaving and doing it after but t came back she forgave me and said i would need to prove to her i could stop lying and be a good person i agreed but i still felt like a monster it wasnt long before i did it again being intersex meant it was nearly impossible for me to get anyone pregnant they told me i was essentially sterile t had had a miscarriage in the past she knew conceiving would be nearly impossible for her too but she desperately wanted kids so did i but knew it wouldnt be easy or likely in a million to one chance we became expecting parents she was pregnant and we were elated things were good but we soon received the news that she had miscarried right at the end of the first trimester i took off time from work sinking back to my lowest depression this effected my job again and i was let go in the meantime i lied about my pto and just took care of t when she found out this time she left rightfully so i got a job and moved and basically reset again missing t terribly all the while having her tell me how much she wished we could be together i knew i couldnt stop lying i knew shouldve stopped talking to her now im teetering on the edge having lost everyone i care about disappointed my family and truly understand the only way to make sure no one is hurt by me again is to remove the problem me if i didnt exist none of this would be here i can make sure i never hurt anyone again if i can grow the courage to end it either way please heed my story if youre any sort of compulsive liar narcissist or something similar please im begging you get help come out of the dark and tell the goddamn truth edited for clarity be good to each other so long all b,1

hunter x hunter has way to many antilgbt fans for being like one of the biggest mainstream animes with gay and transgender characters in it like literally any fan theory and people accept the possibility of it except if you mention the possibility of gon and killua being gaybisexual then they will freak out and say theyre 100 straight and theyre too young to know what being gay is but they can know theyre straight and theres literally so many clues that suggest its possible that they are in love more than just friends plus its just fucking cute to think about it like if someone wants to ship them and make their fan stories about them then like wtf why not and the fact they never have a problem with shipping male female characters who werent canonically in love but then theres a problem if theyre gay thats pure homophobia,0

opinion i seriously do not understand why ps4 exclusives receive so much praise everytime sony or the ps4 is brought up on reddit or youtube i hear nothing but man sony has killed it this generation no praise to the devs who made the games here just the corporation that lets them do it its like saying feminism should be credited to men because men let women vote or these exclusives are some of the best games ive played in a decade ive played the following ps4 exclusives god of war iv persona 5 horizon zero dawn bloodborne the last of us uncharted 4 in other words the most praised ones aside from spiderman because im going to wait on that one a bit after being disappointed by god of war iv and persona 5 preordered gow4 and persona 5 for ps4 and ps3 keep in mind that im only talking exclusives not multiplats of all the games listed only 1 has failed to disappoint bloodborne mainly due to the atmosphere art direction gameplay combat and customization even if i think there could be more build variety other than that just about everything else ive mentioned has been hugely disappointing in some way to me god of war ivs combat was seriously overhyped no its not like dark souls or bloodborne in the least the only similarities are that they have the same control scheme cameras way too close a lot of enemies are spongy and dodging feels extraordinarily clumsy it also seriously lacked in enemy variety what a shame since they had all of norse mythology at their fingertips they couldve used nidhoggr or sleipnir in boss battles they even showed hresvelgr but he was just a background prop wouldve been pretty interesting to fight him in other words i dont think the game uses the full potential or norse mythology to its advantage for enemy variety and art direction as for the writing its not bad but at the same time its got that sort of your princess is in another castle problem where whenever they reach their apparent objective oop nope it aint over because x happens persona 5 had dungeons that could be good at times however at other times they ended up being sameysamey mazey corridors that feel less like im exploring them but more like im taking the longest route possible from point a to b as for writing im actually baffled at how poorly the game handles its messages beating us over the head with the palaces symbolism without letting the player figure it out for themselves it handles its subject matter with little to no nuance after kamoshida and constantly undermines its own themes presenting the phantom thieves as 100 right even though it claims that they are morally grey as for the characters i kind of just found them annoying and most of them dont even do shit for the story after their arc also if character development doesnt do anything for the story then fuck off its ultimately a game that thinks its being super clever but in reality its incredibly oversimplified and dumbeddown horizon zero dawn holy shit i said i didnt like p5s characters but at least they had some personality and i can remember their fucking names the only characters i remember from horizon were aloy rost and sylens and even then i seriously dont get why aloy is so highly praised she has a cool character design and a mildly interesting origin but thats it she is such a goddamn boring character also i dont care about whats happening now with hades or some idiot conspiracy with the shadow carja i want to actually play as the dudes during the apocalypse since thats the only interesting part also the gameplay its good on paper but perhaps it was just me but im really used to mouse and keyboard aiming so it kind of felt clunky with some horrendous melee combat and the open world is just meh tedious side quests without interesting stories or thanks to the healing system i have to constantly scrounge around and look for medicine to give you some perspective into how bland i found the characters i literally can say more about a side quest character in ac odyssey on my what 20 hour playtime so far than i can say about most of the cast in hzd after 35 hours the last of us has some solid character writing and not to mention that the sound design is quite good as well unfortunately thats plagued with generic third person action gameplay and isnt very scary or tense not to mention that there is literally nothing i havent seen before in the game serious dad trying to protect kid or kid surrogate check seen that before in bioshock infinite and walking dead cinematic coverbased overtheshoulder thirdpersonshooter with stealth elements 3 of naughty dogs games on the ps3 horizon zero dawn spec ops the line gears of war max payne etc etc to be fair though cliches arent inherently a problem unless done poorly hero academia proves that things can be cliche yet still great uncharted 4 pretty much the same as the last of us but with even less stakes and worse writing gameplays a bit better but with a few things like a grappling hook mechanic and whatnot so i suppose thats an improvement but not by much what sucks about all of this for me is that on paper a lot of these games have what i want god of war 4s a semiopen world with 3rd person melee based combat with great graphics with a huge emphasis on story and characters all based on norse mythology sounds awesome horizon is a sprawling open world with tons of different environments postapocalyptic a unique aesthetic based around killing robot dinosaurs hell yeah persona 5 is a characterdriven jrpg that covers taboo subjects and has an awesome comicbook aesthetic thats neat hell spiderman also has what i want based on my favourite superhero of all time with arkhamstyle combat featuring a huge selection of classic comicbook villains set in an open world of new york where we can swing around as we please but i am extremely cautious about that game can someone explain why people like these games so much claim they set a new standard for video games and praise the everliving fuck out of them maybe my expectations were unreasonable and i should play them again without any comparison to other games i liked,0

you know whats really sad few weeks ago when i was on camp and was just hanging out with supposedly straight guys i was supposed to sleep with in a tent we were just playing around them acting very gaylike which i appreciate since im gay while im just there like okay everything was fine before the topic of gays came up this dude was like what do you think of gays i expected positive answers considering how they were acting that night but instead got the worst possible results ever they all agreed that they should all belong in hell at that moment my heart broke why wtf was wrong with them i slightly tried to hint arguments against their statement but only slightly as to not accidentally out myself no avail they then quickly moved on to another topic because the atmosphere was getting quite heavy to this day they still act gay and tbh im kinda attracted to this one guy he occasionally gives me hugs and tells me pick up lines then i tell them one back in an instant because i keep some in my head but im pretty sure he is straight but thats my dilemma i dont know if any of them are actually gay its just so hard to read guys when they are acting so gay idk why every guy in high school acts so gay at least they cant read me back anyway please send help this guy just doesnt want to leave my mind hes got cute funny a great hugger cute funny has a great personality and i feel like i wanna be with him forever he is the only person who has made me felt this way since my previous rejection help im trying to keep options but god fucking damn it being gay is hard,0

my bf 21 beat my dog after pulling him out from under the bed by his taillegs and was lunged at weve been living together for a year and recently ive found myself feeling like an idiot fool me once type of situation id say we have 75 great times but the rest is definitely worse than bad as a bit of backstory my partner cares very much about how his family percieve him and so when they first came to visit he opened the front door to welcome them inside as he didnt want to keep them waiting i was shouting no repeatedly as i didnt have a hold of my dog his gran has hip problems i didnt want the dog knocking her over and my dog ran out to greet them ran straight onto the street and was clipped by a car not only did my partner not bother to listen to me he also didnt care for his gran potentionally being knocked off balance or my dog getting out onto the street anyway after being clipped by a car my dog was spooked and ran off we finally caught him put a lead on him and walked him home during which my partner kept yanking on the lead and pulling his head onto his knee and lashed out at me when i told him to hand him back as he was being too rough he called him a stupid dog for not listening and running off etc i told him he was just excited there was new people and unfortunately he was already out by that point it wasnt his fault it was my partners fault for not listening we moved on and he swore hed never do it again until last night we were in bed and heard pup under the bed rustling around bf leans down to pull him out and i look over to see him physically shaking with exertion of pulling at him and hear pup growling lots of noise and yelping so i called at him to stop and at that point pup lunges at him and supposedly bites him he was under the bed there are no bite marks he hasnt broken skin or bruised him i really think he just lunged and mouthed at him out of feardiscomfort pup immediately crawls out my side of the bed and cowers behind me bf storms over and wallops him hes a collie dog hes not a small dog and he fully recoils bf is still mad and comes at him a second time but pup yelps and lunges again again no contact just a lot of defense tactics i was absolutely disgusted by the exchange and the more i replay it in my head the more repulsed i am by my partner if my dog was my child and bf was step father would he punish my child for drawing on the wall by smacking him rather than explaining not to draw on the walls i feel so heart broken and helpless as he swears it will never happen again but this is already the second time its happened and i feel like a fool for giving a second chance never mind a third but i also feel like maybe i would be a fool to throw away something that is great the majority of the time for something that may not happen again im just scared to give him that third chance me and pup are staying at my parents at the moment but its not a long term thing so i feel i have to make up my mind i just dont know what to do this week has also been a very difficult week after having to give my foster brother some difficult news about his biological family and myself being diagnosed with a precancerous autoimmune disease so i dont feel like im handling any of it very well and dont want to end my relationship just because i didnt handle the news well or something please send help tldr my partner lashed out at my dog after letting him out on the street by accident and swore hed never hit him again proceeded to beat him months later after being lunged at for pulling him out from under the bed by his legstail,0

my 22m friend 21m ghosts me reconnects then turns sour i have no idea whats going on with him or what i should do im 22m hes 21m we met at the gym we are not gym buddies but sometimes we are there same time so we talk weve been friends for 4 months now weve always been nice to each other however one thing ive noticed are his mood swings something ive noticed since ive seen him in the gym before we started talking on some days he is in a good mood and is sociable but on some days hes cold and wont reply much this november the latter has been more frequent id get scanty replies be it through text or face to face and i dont think anyone would like that id ask if hes ok and hed say the generic response im fine he has never shown any signs that he does not like me as a matter of fact its the opposite as a friend if we havent seen each other in a week and then we do hed say something like its good to see you i havent seen you in a while on some occasion he seems happy to see me and looks upset when i leave he also shows moderate forms of affection see below we went from fist bumps to handshakes to those brohug handshakes which he was the first to start doing mid november on one occasion he pat me on the waist when he said goodbye to me that might seem like a small matterbut its a bit romantic for a dude to do that to another although im not bothered by it and definitely you wont do that to someone you dont like from mid november onwards he has been a bit cold and his bad days were more frequent hed reply me with one word up front and gets annoyed when i try talking to him at one point he even snapped when i asked a question he had gone sour with me all of a sudden i confronted him through text that eventhough i apologized for the question i shouldve recieved one for being snapped at and since he has no interest in talking to me lately i wont be talking to him i got no response a week later i realize everyone makes mistakes and have bad days and i shouldnt retaliate at the first mistake especially since he has been nice to me in the past i send an apology for retaliating eventhough i deserve one because i dont want to make things worse for him still no response eventually i meet him at the gym and we do that brohug thingas if weve moved forward i ask to talk to him after hes done working out and he said ok he didnt he went straight home and sent me a text saying he doesnt want to talk and goes to the gym just to workout and only that not to talk seeing how we might not talk anymore i told him how i felt how ive always felt like hes going through something because i noticed the mood swings told him he can still talk to me if he needs someone to talk to and if he doesnt want to talk to me talk to someone because bottling things are bad no response also we havent blocked each other and at no point have we attacked each other personally im a bit worried about his wellbeing and quite upset that i may have lost a friend my fear is that stress and anxiety atleast are getting to him eventually we bumped into each other at christmas day and we wished each other a merry christmas however the rest of the day he avoided eye contact and the bad vibes were still there three weeks afterwards we bump i to each other and this time he initiates he waves at me from a far and sooner he actually came up to me and started having a convo it was a good convo good vibes a few weeks later havent seen him since i follow him on his unprivate instagram but no follow back im utterly confused at his behaviour does he want to be friends or not furthermore i am leaving the state soon for a very long time and i have not seen him since i want to text him asking if hes okbut i feel unwelcomed to do thatbut a part of me thinks how worse can things get already and i should send him a text anywaysreally dont know what to do he has mentioned his family has it difficult sometimes because they have so much things to pay insurances their schooling and etc and i think he might be struggling he has also just finished college which he said is difficult to pay for 2 weeks after finishing college and hes already frustrated about having to find work he seems to really need it i dont know if that is enough to assume someone is having a hard time finances are a big thing can these and perhaps some other stuff be affecting his behaviour i am worriedalthough we may never speak to each other again tldr friend turns cold then reconnects then cold again,0

the smug style in american game diversity you dont need a black guy in medieval bohemia yeah i stole that title from emmett rensinurl for a while now there has been a big push and subsequent reaction for more diversity in video game characters and its one of those internet flame wars what always felt particularly annoying to me because the reactionary cries of evil sjw infiltrating our games are insufferable and as a dude in the left i would be expected to side with the opposite side but the myopic approach of the woke gaming press and muricacentric liberals that yass queen at them makes me unable to do so part 1 suspension of disbelief or where did that brown dude came from one of the reasons why this push for diversity whiting and outside the industry is annoying to watch is because for the most part it feels like exactly what it is soulless marketing a group of business men in a conference room using the words target demographic a lot decided that the game needed more diversity and that resulted in the final product i dont think any game gave me more of that feeling than dragon age inquisition now dai isnt the most diverse game i have played but its the most artificially diverse one for those who dont know a lot of dai takes place in a kingdom called ferelden a backwards barbarian protonationalist land infected with racism that forces minorities into ghettos not that you would know that from being there because if the game overworld is to be believed the entire place is actually a renaissance fair being held in queens ny the issue at hand here is the artificiality of all all of this could have being accomplished in a better way and i know that because the elder scrolls does so if i see a black man walking down the road in skyrim and ask myself where did he come from i can answer that with many hypotheticals maybe he is a sellsword who crossed from hammerfell to take advantage of the war maybe he is a refugee form the chaotic situation on his homeland or maybe he is a former member of the imperial legion who deserted if i ask myself the same question while playing dai i can only give one answer because some dude in a suit said this test well with the 1825 year old demographic to reduce the diversity of man to a marketing strategy is unpleasant because then said diversity will only exist as far as it helps sell something the issue will only exist or be tackle in safe ways that whatever target demographics the men in suits chose will find tolerable no boundary will be pushed no statement will be daring the society of the spectacle is all that remains and this is basically an unavoidability in any mass produced piece of capitalist media but i would rather be fooled by todd howard to believe otherwise for a few hours than sit throw dai which refuses to even dissimulate what it is doing part 2 brooklyn diversity or eurocentrism but woke have you guys ever heard of afrocentrism those weird black dudes who insist that a myriad of european historical figures from mozart to isabella i of castile were actually black because reasons such quirky folks anyway thats pretty much how a lot of games approach the subject of worldbuilding take the same old setting traditionally filled with white dudes and just spray nonwhite nondudes at random thats how you end with generic medieval europe magic land but with black people in it and anglosaxon battalion in ww2 but with women in it this is a type of diversity that i usually call brooklyn diversity mostly because i dont know what else to call it diversity as imagined by some white chick from brooklyn who dated a black dude once but only to anger her parents or in less snarky terms diversity as understood from an aggressively uscentric view of the world diversity is not fulani hausa yoruba and igbo nor german poles hungarians and serbians diversity is only understood as the categories made by a myopic us worldview which is whites and people of color that dreaded pigeonholed people of color the ones that need representation and everything is ok as long as the poc get representation the fundamental flaw in this worldview was never more blatant than in the controversy surrounding kingdom come deliverance and its lack of diversity of course kingdom come hardly lacks diversity there is a myriad of ethnic groups portrayed in it but thats not what the american woke commentator wants the american woke commentator wants brooklyn diversity they want the poc actual demographics of medieval bohemia be dammed of course they dont specify what poc they want because they are all interchangeable and if some random arab had showed up in 15th century sazava that would absolutely count as enough representation and all poc of the world would have rejoice about how much representation there was in the game now ultimately thats the ideal for the american call for game diversity a familiar homogenized and first world western friendly setting splattered with enough poc to fill the diversity quota and the entire world should be satisfied with that i am not satisfied with that,0

no drugs where harmed in the making of this episode ive never posted on reddit before but i decided this time i wanted to share im thankful to anyone just reading this ok im going to try and put in written word what ive just spent fifteen minutes explaining to myself out loud im going to try and stick to exactly what i said it started with thinking about my relationship with trying to put into words what it was what it meant and of course as usual lately i couldnt i realised i didnt want to talk about him anymore when before i was dying to talk about him to anyone i met now the only things that come to mind to talk about him are stigmas or labels superficial and fake so i cant wont talk about him i realised at that point that i was the only one trying to come up with a story anything to talk about him accurately that this wasnt at all a concern of his that what i thought was over had actually occurred once again i was going through experiences life alone that anything i went through when i was a kid i was always alone in that feeling that experience that moment and i would have thought that would change the day i went through an experience you cant possible go through alone a relationship it takes two people to share a relationship to make every step forward or backward yet somehow i found myself going through it alone in the end being alone in a relationship that didnt mean anything to the other person anymore i then realised that i was condemned to spending life and experiences alone that i could share them with people but ultimately everything i felt i would always feel alone would never be able to feel the true communion of my feelings with those of another person the one time i shouldve it only lasted for the blink of an eye and was probably an illusion to begin with that shattered when he left i started realising that i now knew how my life was going to end and exactly how i was going to go through life the only thing i couldnt know in advance were the minute moments in between the chapters in my life where i would feel alive and like anything could happen a few seconds in a day a few hours in a month a few weeks in a year 2 weeks was that enough enough to hold onto to look forward to in an otherwise open book what was the point in the end whats the point i dont see these thoughts as suicidal i feel like my mind has opened up at 360 degrees that i see everything know everything im not sad specifically yes im sad generally speaking but not specifically im scared that ive already made up my mind im scared that i dont have a say in my own life i dont want to die i dont want to grow tired of trying and give up at 28 im scared ive made up my mind im not too lazy to live i just know theres no point in trying because theres something wrong with me and ive been taking the side path my entire life when everyone else has been on the main road,1

my partner wants me to throw out my bed because my ex slept in it hey all my partner and i are having a baby in 3 months were looking at moving into a new house together because she doesnt like the house im in now there is nothing wrong with my current house except that i lived there with my ex partner for 3 years but who cares right its just a house so my partner refuses to move in to this current place so iv agreed to find a new place with her she wants me to throw out literally everything i own and start fresh with her iv agreed to some stuff for example ill get new cuttlery and a washing nachine etc because its nice to have some new stuff but iv refused to sell my modular couch which was a few thousand dollars and my bed which was about 1800 she wanted me to get rid of my 75 tv because i may have watched tv and slept with my ex on the couch but i talked her out of it which she thinks is a conpromise on her end she believes its a custom to get new stuff when u start a new relationship and that my old stuff has bad energy i looked it up and they said u can use sage to cleanse bad energy even though i dont believe in that stuff lol but it wasnt good enough her side of the story is that before we met up when were were talking and getting to know eachother my exs dad died and she showed up at my place and i slept with her and apparently for some reason my stuff reminds her of that in my defense i wasnt seeing my partner or dating her we had never met only talked if i made heaps of money and could afford to blow it on a new couch and bed etc then i would but reality is i dont and i dont see anything wrong with keeping it i said if she doesnt like it she doesnt have to sit on the couch or sleep on the bed i agreed to upgrade once i can afford it but shes saying she wont move in with me if i bring my stuff is she being unreasonable or am i should i stand my ground or am i wrong to want to keep it if im wrong then im wrong but what do u think my partner is absolutely lovely with an amazing kind heart im in no way trying to put her down but in my opinion i think she needs a bit of a reality check sometimes or maybe i do let me know guys thanks,0

gf 26f keeps in contact with multiple exes i 32m have been dating a 26f for about 4 months were both comfortable with each others histories however she maintains contact by text ig and occasionally meeting 3 of her exes she claims theyre just friends and i am giving her the benefit of the doubt however i am not okay with it i asked her if she would be okay with me messaging and hanging out with my exes and she said probably not i asked her how her previous ltp felt about this all and she said it was a problem with him too so i put it to her like this the way you choose to operate in life and in a relationship is neither right nor wrong so if you value sending ig posts back and forth and platonic lunches more than our relationship you can continue and ill move on theres something about not being able to separate from your past and carrying around a bevy of guys from your past that feels icky and like theres too many opportunities for dramatrouble am i overreacting or is it weird also i asked my female friend not an ex or hookup or anything if she was friends with her exes and if it was odd she said yes shes friends with them no it isnt that weird then i asked if she fucked them after they became exes and she said hell yeah so on top of that my best friend was dating this girl and she was close with an ex long story short a platonic meet up ended in sex and then my friend and her broke up tldr gf of a few months still texts dms and ocassionally meets up with 3 exes and i want to know if im being ridiculous in asking her to make a decision between them or me,0

ik this is weird but help me find this book ok so im trying to find this book that i read around 2011 when i was like in 2nd or 3rd grade i never finished it because it was while i was staying at a relatives home and i havent gone back there i just suddenly remembered it it was a yaish novel the main character was a teenage girl i think it would maybe be written in the 90s i only vaguely remember one scene and i hope this isnt some weird fever dream hallucination maybe the book doesnt exist and im just crazy the scene the girl and this boy she has had a crush on go to a park like a central park of a city idk if it was nyc or not they get their caricatures done the boy has a unibrow that she finds charming and the caricature depicts the unibrow as being like barbed wire for some reason i specifically remember it being described as barbed wire they laugh and kiss on the grass im pretty sure it is the characters first kiss i remember i liked the book and ik it is weird that 78 year old me would only remember the kissing part but seriously i want to read that book and actually finish it this time please help or maybe its not real and im just crazy lol,0

i was gonna troll this sub but now im serious my time has comemonths ago i trolled some subs such as rtifu idk if you have ever read the story of a guy dating a mental hospital runaway it got many upvotes and it belonged to me i actually troll subs especially when im depressed rather than when im bored because all the fake stories i write displays my inner world and people replying to them makes me happy makes me feel like thered be someone supporting me if such things happened today i was feeling down again i decided to troll this sub too i texted my best friend about it and she said what an empty person you are now instead of a fake story im posting my reality im such an empty person as she said i was going to make some people triggered with my fake story i dont want to encourage anyone to commit suicide never wanted it but i deserve to die as im only something a worthless shit my friends tell me my suicidal thoughts are normal as im 17 and dont even care about me none of them tries to give me affection at least i cant stand living in the same world with such cruel people my family showers me with love but still i feel frustrated i know that theyll die one day and ill completely be alone so i want to die first because i can never ever live if i dont feel anyones affection thats my nature im also hopeless about my future i used to be someone successful with a bunch of dreams now im left alone with my failures and suicidal thoughts years ago my aunt told me youll become nothing youll only get married getting married is an insult here as the actual meaning here is achieving nothing but getting married idk if i could explain clearly and i think she was somewhat right and somewhat wrong she was right i achieved nothing she was wrong i will never even be able to get married im too young but still i feel my future which wont even exist i know that you dont understand any shit from my text my writing skills suck as i do i used to care my grammar mistakes a lot but they dont mean anything to me anymore everything has ended for me nothing has a meaning and im a mess i tried to commit suicide 2 times in this year i prepared everything but didnt continue as im too coward to do anything idk if ill do now or not i dont even know what do i do why do i exist it was good to know you all if im dead if im not dead ill come back i dont know what im saying im probably insane im so sorry im fucked up,1

the guy 20m im 18f in love with ended up having sec with another girl so this might be pretty long but ive been on and off with this guy for about a year and 6 months a brief backstory of how we met is through a random group chat on kik then it moved to a snapchat group chat we talked briefly and we started a streak with each other for the heck of it during this time he was living in new york then one day he sent a streak and at the bottom it said my city name i messaged him and i was so shocked because he didnt know my city prior to this and i asked him why hes visiting his response was that he was staying with his cousin and he was wondering why i wanted to know i told him that i live in that exact city we were both excited because i thought it was really cool but he was excited because hes always been interested in me about two weeks later i ended up visiting where he was staying and the place was right across from my friends house a street down from my brother and about a 10 minute drive away from my house i thought it was some kind of fate after that we just couldnt get enough of each other and ended up becoming a couple through the course of our relationship it was great for the first month and then things started to take a turn for the worst when we started dating i was still a virgin and i decided that i wanted to wait until marriage i told him this and he didnt really want this but he still went along because he was very interested in me even though i decided i wanted to wait until marriage i ended up giving in to temptation and he took my virginity i felt awful but we continued to do it multiple times around the fourth time i invited him over to my house and i wasnt expecting anyone to be home until 500 pm we ended up having sex again without a condom and i was super scared because i thought i was pregnant on top of being scared that i was pregnant this resulted in me having to take a plan b my dad came home early he caught us i had so much anxiety and stress i was on the verge of shutting down my dad didnt even know that i was seeing him and he wouldnt approve of us being together anyways my dad was furious and told him to get out and to never come near me again my boyfriend packed his stuff and left after that i decided to see him after school a week later in secret we were still secretly dating we kept this up for about two months but ultimately we decided to end things the lack of sex sneaking around and barely being able to see him broke us apart i decided that i didnt want to have sex anymore for various reasons my beliefs my anxiety and etc we dated from november 2017 to february 2018 we still had feelings for each other and started talking again in july 2018 we went to the mall and decided to hang out i had fun after about a week we had a long late night phone call and i told him that im still waiting until marriage he sounded disappointed and the call got awkward and we ended up hanging up and that was it he told me that he never wanted to talk to me again and that were just done because we cant make our relationship work in september of 2018 he was talking to another girl and i would hear them flirt with each other because we were in a ps4 party his friend would tell me you see that and he made me realize what they were doing and i felt like absolute crap long story short his friend started making moves on me and i ended up going on a date with him just to move my heart away from the situation my ex boyfriend found out and it made him so upset he ended up messaging me and he called me crying and said that he wants me back even if we had to go through these trials he still wanted me back because he said he loves me and he cant see me with anyone else but him we decided to get back together again and everything was running pretty smoothly we went on dates and i would see him more but not having sex was really hard in january 2019 we ended up having a talk again and we broke up the reason i put that in quotations is because even though we broke up i would see him alll the time i would go over and cook for him play games with him sleep in the same bed with him and flirt with him we still talked about our future together our wedding moving in together having kids with one another traveling the world together etc so it was basically like we were still in a relationship we just didnt have the title and we werent have sex this month march 2019 while he was sleeping i went through his phone and found out that he was texting another girl that he called his friend he once told me that this friend might come over his house and they would hang out because they were just friends i wasnt okay with it but i said okay i went on instagram and saw the messages they were exchanging each other and usually they text on imessage but i didnt even attempt to scroll through all that because what i saw on instagram was enough he said i want to fck you so bad rn she said havent gotten enough of insert my name he replied by saying i dont have sex with that girl i havent had sex with anybody since you at first i thought it was a joke i screenshot it sent it to my phone and deleted the evidence from his phone i went home and cried i needed time to think about everything before i confronted him the next day i made him breakfast and i headed over to his house we were laying in his bed and we had a long talk about things about life in general and he was smiling and flirting with me and i was smiling too because i kept telling myself that it wasnt true after he ate the breakfast i made he laid down on my lap and said that hes going to sleep he had no idea about what i found the day before and so while he was laying down for a minute i told him that i had to ask him a question he said okay i was like are you ready and he looked kindve worried and said yeah i showed him the screenshot and his eyes got super wide i knew that there was a condom in his drawer 4 weeks prior to our conversation and i looked that day while he was in the shower and it was gone so i asked him about it and he swallowed really hard and didnt know what to say so i asked him calmly if she came over and if they really had sex he said that they did i was so heartbroken i still am im not sure how to react because he said that were not together but he admits and says that what he did was wrong i cried in front of him and he just kept hugging me saying that hes sorry and that he knows that no matter what he says wont really help because his actions says a lot he said that he doesnt love her or want a relationship with her and that he wants all of that with me i asked him why he did it and he says its because i dont have sex with him i dont really know what to do or feel i could use some input tldr my boyfriend of a year and a half had sex with another girl due to me not having sex with him,0

my then fiance 37m ditched me28f at the bar to hang out with my toxic ex best friend litterally all night i dont know if this is really somthing to still be angry about and why i still have strong feelings of resentment over it is it normal for me to still feel this way tldr at the bottom me28f and my husband 37m have been married for about two years so this happened a little over a couple years ago while we were engaged and im still pretty pissed about it i dont know why i still harbor resentments over it i was goodbest friends with a girl named bri on and off for about 7 years i was hanging out with her at a friends bbq when i first met my husband after we started dating he hung out with me and bri a lot so him and i get engaged about two years later and during that time me and bri were being friends on and off like 2 or 3 times during my husbands and my realationship she was often a very immature toxic person and also manipulative and she would screw me over be condescending to me super naggy and would sometimes insult me by making little jabs and backhanded compliments now i have a long fuse and not really one to get mad easily irritated or start arguments like at all i like to just sit back relax and have fun i also love to dance and laugh and joke around i would put up with bri until i would just get fed up and temporarily cut her out of my life for a while then after a couple months shed apologize and wed be best friends again until i got fed up again my husband then fiance knew what was going on and how she sometimes would treat me like dirt and how i felt about her i would sometimes vent to him how she acted around me or insulted me or screwed me over etc whenever she pissed me off he always sided with me i even had to call him to pick me and my 3 year old up from the water park because she ditched us there with no ride because my 3 year old said that she didnt like bri because bri kept purposely splashing her in the face and making her cry and bri got mad at me because i wouldnt make my daughter apologize so he was fully aware what it was like between me and bri so a couple weeks go by and i have cooled down a little and she invited me to her birthday party at the bar i occasionally go to the bar maybe once or twice a month so i talked to my fiance and was just discussing if we should go or not and that i was still kinda pissed at her and didnt think i wanted to be friends with her anymore i decided that we did need a night out and said that we will just show up and hang out with her group for a little bit just to say hi to avoid awkwardness and then well just quietly sneak away and go spend the rest of the evening at a different bar so at about 9pm we show up with another mutual friend of herskatie who also had the same plan as i made with my fiance because she was kinda fed up with bri too bri is super annoying and a lot of people get fed up with her quickly including basically every guy she dates this was also the reason why i was friends with her because i felt bad for her not really having friends she did have her good moments though so anyways bri was wearing this white tank top and a super short denim skirt katie and i just rolled our eyes at eachother so the three of us hang out with bri and her little circle of friends on the bars back patio for maybe an hour and katie and i are ready to quietly duck out i give my fiance a look and say that katie and i are going to go inside and order another drink my fiance doesnt follow i didnt think much of it so katie and i are sitting inside at the bar for almost an hour before my fiance finally leaves bris little group and comes in to go to the bathroom by then im kinda pissed when he comes out of the bathroom and goes to the bar to get a drink i give him a wtf look when he sees me and he asks me whats up im pretty irritated but i told him that me and katie are going to the bar across the street and that hes welcome to join us if he wants he said that he just ordered a drink that hell join us in a bit so i just walk off with katie and we go to the bar across the street i ordered another beer and hung out there with her for about 2 hours every 30 mins that he didnt show up to join us i was growing even more and more pissed off my pride was the only thing stopping me from calling him and telling him wtf i also didnt want to be that girl who goes over there and drags him away my pride was already hurt over it but i didnt want to give bri the satisfaction of seeing me do that i know her and i know she was most likely smugly gloating to herself about my fiance hanging out with her all night instead of with me so i was standing outside with katie and im not only fuming but also feeling very betrayed when i see bris little birthday group leave the bar across the street and they started walking to the bar next door to it with my fiance tagging along with them i yelled out my fiances name as hes about to go inside and when he looks over at me i hold up my arms like wtf he didnt even attempt to respond and just went inside the bar with everyone else even katie was incredulous it takes a lot to get me mad but that made me livid i was like fk this lets have another beer i dont need him blah blah so another two hours rolls by and its bar close i am not going to be seen by bri and her catty little clique by showing up 4 hours later to pull my fiance away from the group they all knew he ditched his fiance to hang out with bri all night whats worse is that bri was fully aware he has never ditched me when we would go out together ever if i would go to another bar with my friends hed always find me and join us so im like fk him im going home so the way i walk home i have to cross the street and pass the back patio of the bar as im walking by i see my fiance sitting with her group right next to her and then she stood up to thank everyone for hanging out with her for her birthday and he stood up too and they gave eachother a friendly little hug that stung me i just kept walking and walked all the way home he showed up 10 minutes later and acted like everything is normal and is all super pleasant and cheesy with me asking if i had a good night i wanted to sleep before i confronted him about it the next day i talked to him about it i told him that it really hurt me he had the most stupidest excuses that made no sense they were so stupid that it angered me even more so i decided to drop it this was two years ago and i have completly cut off all contact with bri and i havent talked to her since its obvious that i still have resentments over that night i try not to think of it but sometimes the memory pops back up and i hate it oh in case if youre wondering what his excuses were here they are first it was like i thought we were supposed to be hanging out at her party i thought you were wanting to be friends with her again and i reminded him about our discussion before where i said that we would show up for a drink then duck out to which i did when i went inside and waited for him for almost an hour at the bar then his excuse for when he came out of the bathroom and got another drink inside and i told him me and katie were going across the street was you seemed irritated with me so i didnt think you wanted me around you to which i responded so instead you choose to hang out all night with the one girl that you know i dont like because she treats me like shit and is super annoyingand toxic him again you said that you wanted to be friends with her again which was the exact opposite of what i told him before we left and i said that i had left the party expecting him to come with too and he said i wasnt really hanging out with her i was talking with her dad all night and there wasnt really anyone else at the bar to talk to mind you my husband is a social butterfly he loves to socialize and can talk about absolutely anything with anybody it was a saturday night in a small town there were a ton of people at the bar that he could have talked to because we know a lot of people including the bartenders so i said so the whole night you did not see one person at the bar to talk to other than her dad he said yeah also when it was 2am and i saw him on the back patio when i was leaving her dad wasnt even there any more my husband was sitting in a chair right next to her so i asked him why he ignored me later on when i called out to him a couple hours later from across the street when he was tagging along with the group again he said he was having a fun time talking with her dad i mentioned that when i saw him at the end of the night her dad wasnt even there anymore and that i saw him sitting next to her and gave her a hug he said that he hugged her because it was the nice thing to do i then took an educated guess to test him by saying that her dad had left hours ago by then he just stared at me blankly my guess was right i then told him that the entire time that we have been in a relationship that he has never ditched me to hang out with some dude all night that he didnt really know when we would go out together again he said that there was not anyone else at the bar for him to talk to which i know is complete bullshit even after i told him that her dad had left hours ago he had no justifiable response to that of course he stuck to those excuses and wouldnt budge its not like hes actually going to admit the real reason he stayed at her party was probably because she was looking hot wearing a white tank top and mini denim skirt tldr my fiance37m ditched me28f at the bar to hang out with my toxic ex friend litterally all night and gave me the stupidest excuses as to why,0

is my 20f crush 20m interested in me if so why doesnt he speak up i 20f really like this guy 20m who goes to the same university as me after seeing him around campus for months i worked up the courage to message him on instagram near the end of april which is something i rarely do also that day one of his very good friends who hes with a lot at school followed me on instagram too i thought that was a good sign fast forward to right now his twin brother followed me on instagram a few days ago as well as another friend of his but i feel like the friend couldve been a coincidence he initially caught my eye because over the months i noticed hed stare at me pretty often in passing he is also a psychology major just like me has awesome style appears shy and reserved has great music taste and is amazing at art he had asked me to hangout 2 days in a row after i messaged him but it just so happened that i couldnt on those days so he gave me his number to text him if i wanted to meet up because instagram messaging was too difficult i thought it was nice of him to go out of his way to do that i had texted him a week later due to my anxiety and he was busy that week but said he was still totally down to hangout sometime that weekend he came over to me at this festival our school was having and struck up conversation with me it was the first time we met later that week he spotted me in the library and asked to go for coffee that weekend may 11 i finally went and it was awesome he was so polite he paid for my drink he was very nice and the conversation was interesting we talked about music our majors my photography his art just random things like that i thought it was sweet because at one point he mentioned the bar his sister works at saying it was old fashioned themed and he goes oh you would love it he had mentioned that in high school he was shy and barely said a word which i thought was interesting considering i thought he appeared shy after we walked back to campus we hugged and he told me he had fun and that we should do it again and for me to text him if i wanted to hangout again later that same night he added me on snapchat now for those of you who have snapchat especially people my age you know about the snapchat score his is very low as opposed to an average users 29000 some mine is 460000 because ive had it since i was 13 lol this makes me think he isnt much of a phone person as ive never seen him on it in person even when i would just see him around campus but i could be wrong fast toward to the last week of school the week after we hung out i had asked him to hangout and he responded with for sure we were going to hangout but then the next day he caught me as i was getting in the elevator at the library he said my name and then jogged up to me and told me that he didnt think he would be able to see me later he didnt say why but i had assumed it was because of finals or packing he then told me that he just wanted to say goodbye that he hoped i had a good summer and to keep in touch okay he hugged me and that was the last time i saw him during the school year 2 days before break it is now summer obviously he snapchats me very frequently we have had a streak here and there but my only concerns are as follows 1 if hes interested in me which maybe he isnt why doesnt he continue the snapchat conversation for awhile he is usually the one to leave me open end it fairly abruptly sometimes well have casual humorous chit chat but nothing deep maybe hes rather have those conversations in person or he just doesnt care 2 maybe he is shy and is interested in me but wont say anything for some reason does he not want to mess up over the summer and keep things light so we can hangout when he gets back or has he just not even thought about that 3 i feel like he knows enough about me to be interested he knows my interests my energy things like that so what is up with this kid it drives me nuts because i want him so badly i got the ball rolling so why cant he speak up tldr my crush regularly contacts me but is strange in the way that he does it he hasnt outwardly flirted with me and i cant tell if hes just shy or not into me like that its bothering me and i dont want to have to ask him,0
most of the people that say my trauma made me funny are not funny at all they legit just repeat the same phrases i cant stand them,0
dae start deadass hallucinating when theyre stressed started happening last year during midterms and finals this year its only happening during finals and really only because im stressing about how im never gonna see most of my friends again next year the hallucinations for me are really mostly just seeing a person out of the corner of your eye or seeing a black figure on the ceiling then looking up and its gone last year i remember hearing growls randomly that nobody else could and feeling really uneasy randomly and being paranoid as shit i dont have the auditory hallucinations or feelings anymore thankfully,0
she said yes my mom said that i could have my friends come to my epic sleepover,0
things worked out love story nearly 10 years in the making when i was 14 years old first month of high school a class mate of mine shot me a text stating he had a crush on me this was a surprise because up until a week ago this classmate was not fond of me found out recently that the reason they didnt like me was because they always want to be the smartest kid in the room and their ego didnt like that i was a good student too lol we dated for a month afterwards and i broke up with him after a month because he was so shy he wouldnt even hold my hand we stayed closed friends he dated others i dated others fast forward to junior year im dating a mutual friend of ours who is extremely toxic manipulative and abusive my self esteem and quality of life are at an all time low i was young and naive and didnt realize my current partner was abusive thats just how men show love super traumatic childhood and upbringing i had a warped perception of love my friend confesses hes never lost feelings for me that he just wanted to grow into a person that would make me happy no pressure if i didnt want to be with him that would be fine he told me that love wasnt what i was getting from my current boyfriend though and that i deserved better some time passes and i break up with my abusive partner and give them another chance and he treats me so good unbelievably good never raises his voice or hits me he is kind and gentle and patient and i become so scared when does the other shoe drop i begin to self sabotage our relationship making up mountains of molehills its common for folks who have abusive pasts to always be on guard if no one in your life has been kind to you before then what does this guy gain by being kind to me now whats the motive queue abusive ex threatens to kill himself if i dont do as he wants uses his own history of abuse to justify his abuse to me im 16 and still so naive and i fold i immediately come clean and tell my partner we break up i give him space few months go by he tells me that he still loves me and wants to try again we stay together for the remainder of high school we decide to go to two different universities far from one another long distance doesnt work and we agree to split up again four years pass i date different people he goes on a few dates we see each other every break we go home he is just as kind as always and i assume that hes moved on which kills me because i miss him we graduate with our degrees and im looking towards my masters completely focused on my career getting out from under my abusers he asks me to meet him for coffee which is very normal as i said we make a point of always seeing one another he is nervous and it all just comes spilling out he says hes always loved me from when we were 14 and so stupid that when he yearns for someone to fall asleep next to its always me he wants that when he is asleep and dreams of his future family he always sees me as the mother of his children and when he day dreams of growing old its next to me he couldnt find a partner during college because every woman wasnt the one im ecstatic but if my life has taught me anything its that you cant rely on anyone and the way others treat you can be fickle i tell him that although im glad i have my career to focus on he says all he wants is me it always has been and he offers to move to the city im studying in put his career on hold so i can pursue my masters that hes sorry hes waited so long to tell me i used to think happy endings didnt happen to people like me too bruised too battered maybe even to broken to deserve happiness from birth till 18 years my life was endless tragedy people like me were too rough around the edges too damaged beyond repair ive been going to therapy to unlearn my trauma and harmful coping skills ive surrounded myself with loving kind supportive people who dont use me to an end ive forged strong bonds with my family ive put myself through school i worked 3 jobs for four years i dont have any debt for my bachelors degree not a single penny to anyone im about to buy my first car all with my own savings and no one elses help i have a job and an internship already lined up to put me through my masters and that little 14 year old boy who was so shy he wouldnt hold my hand hes a fine young man who im happy to call my partner and we are moving into our first apartment together next month whenever we see children while we are out and about he points them out and how excited he is to be a father someday how he cant wait to marry me in the church by his grandmothers house how we wont ever make my birth mothers mistakes life has been a struggle for me to say the least but for the first time i can breathe im free from my past and i have a future that looks like more than pain poverty and homelessness i cant wait to wake up each day from the time i was five i can remember my birth mom telling me to use my looks and sex to manipulate those around me to bend to my will that love wasnt real and only a good rich white mans wife was all id amount to i cant wait for my future with him i cant wait for my career to take off im so glad im still alive and i can finally breathe for the first time im more than fine im great and i can breathe have a good day everyone,0

very thin line every time i open my eyes to the real world around me all i see is just a whole load of shit a whole load of fucked up almost no reason to livebiggest issue is a psychotic step father no sanctuary at home or outside of home only thing that helps me calm down and helps me to find meaning in living is music movies and anime everything that is abstract from whats happening in reality so pathetic and i cant imagine this being a long lasting fix however it works for now just putting some songs on in the background makes me so damn calm again so yeh only reason for living is music and fucking anime you can see how solid the ground is in my life i think about killing myself sometimes but it just doesnt appeal to me to die in that way i want to die helping someone leave the house everyday hoping ill see some event which allows me to trade my life for someone elses because that person probably enjoys life more than me sorry for the ramble first time making my feelings public,1
prozac has changed my life i feel like ive finally dug out of a giant hole instead of dreading being awake most of the time now i feel normal and thats a good thing i wake up do what i need to do for the day and hang out with friends and im able to just enjoy the moment for once my ocd has improved drastically and my mind doesnt loop and twirl nonsensically and invent fears anymore its so great to exist in the present without constant anxiety i am way more social now than i was a year ago i actually look forward to talking to people now i feel much better about myself and my life and my future its crazy to think that the reason for so many years of dark depression was that my brain didnt have enough of a chemical i know that many people have bad experiences with antidepressants but for some reason it has worked quite well for me or it could be a placebo and ive tricked myself into happiness either way works for me brought to you by eli lilly and company,0

tired of trying i dont hope for much in life only love every relationship ends with me getting cheated on or him eventually deciding he doesnt like me anymore outright i have no motivation or hope to try anymore i think its only a matter of time until i succeed in ending my life those who label my thoughts as selfish are the ones i feel are selfish keeping me here so they can feel better i never asked to be born but here i am being told to just be grateful for all the hardship life has to offer gifted with the burden of life im not afraid im done trying ive thought a lot about it my plan is to show up at my exs work and hang myself on the business property he never cared or loved me i loved him but i was just trash to throw away in his eyes i tried moving on and got hurt even worse by others i dont care to be alive and i cant wait to end it once and for all,1

therapy is trash was 4 years in therapy and they aaaall gave up on me because nothing seemed to work i really tried to tell them everything in detail even tho im not good with words the only thing i refused to do was medication because i didnt want to fake what i feel im rather being depressed than being high on happy pills 247 also ive seen what that shit did to my dad all my therapists didnt know what to do no more and their only way in their eyes left was the mediaction which i refused to take so they just locked me up against my will it was horrible i felt trapped isolated from everything misunderstood as always and was treated like shit under all these people who i was told were the same as me i still was getting these looks like i was some sort of psycho i was ignored and just getting dumb looked at just as always even though i tried my best had therapy once a week with a headshrinker who would do nothing but twist the facts great right luckily i was able to get out because i did some really whack things but it worked even though they normally wouldnt let me because im too dangerous for myself and others around me yeah right whatever that was the only thing i achieved through actually really trying lmao sometimes i imagine how it would be if i was still jailed up in there and it fucking scares me was a year ago dont know why im telling this only now but whatever dont even know what to say exactly but i just wanted to tell something i never told anybody anywhere maybe im getting hate for this but okay go for it its all a waste of time,1

after recovering from depression im just grateful to finally be genuinely happy and be able to help people i wish depressed me could see me now it would have provided her so much necessary hope today i taught my lil sis who has no idea how to cook to make pizza from scratch today i accompanied my socially anxious 18 year old cousin to apply for a parttime job he said he felt so productive and i felt happy when i heard that he reminds me of my younger self but less anxious his mum told me he couldnt make friends at school and hated what he was studying so he quit his course after one year and hes retaking our national exam o levels in order to get the desired results to get in another course he really wants i can sense he is a good boy whos just socially anxious he wants to do things but doesnt know how or where to start so he just needs a person to guide him and hell take action immediately im really proud of him he strikes me as a lonely boy who just wants friends but doesnt know how to befriend them tbh i was expecting him to be withdrawn and talk really little but he replied to all of my questions readily and even volunteered information about himself i was pleasantly surprised by him and im just so proud of him for taking a step in the right direction i know he can make lifelong friends at work and school if he just overcomes his social anxiety and interacts with people hehe im just so happy i could help i really am so thankful for his mum for putting her trust in me and giving me a chance to help i told my friend about this she said that when i was depressed i couldnt and didnt want to help people so subconsciously my guilt grew and thats why im helping everyone as much as i can right now in order to relieve my guilt shes right im genuinely happy and i love myself i never thought such a day would come and now that it has im just overwhelmed with gratitude i love my life so much right now thanks so much for reading,0
convince me not to hello reddit im 21 and i want to die not sure why but i do i have virtually no one to talk to im always alone i try to appear happy when im not on the inside im great at faking it i have spent almost an hour deciding if i should post this or not finally decided i should go ahead and do it since this is the only place i can i would get stopped if i told any of my friends heres what im like the only thing im good at is gaming people think im annoying no real friends i talk too much im good at isolating myself gaming all day sleeping 15 hours failing school swearing driving fast 100 mph keeping my depression a secret spending vast amounts of money on in game currency thinking of death i have taken many notes on what hurts and what does not ideally i would love to blow my brains out with a shotgun but guns are expensive and im too lazy to get a license assisted suicide is illegal in my state plus people would try to stop me starvation would take forever lack of sleep if i didnt sleep for 12 days people would eventually catch on and stop me drugs would mess me up if i fail i would love to go skydiving with no parachute but you need training and such to go alone i dont have a garage to poison myself with co im not smart enough to make cyanide or ricin im not interested in the thought of cutting my neck open drowning or hanging doesnt seem very fun death by train cop or car would potentially hurt others i would rather not take others with me last one i looked at was immolation if that was the only way i would have to find a way to numb the pain a summary of my suicide death research this post would be too long if i did all of it jumping has a high success rate and i know that there will be a few that miss me but they will soon forget me my dad has als and ive decided that i cant stand to watch him suffer i have the note ready to go and all i have to do now is plan when to go im still trying to convince myself not to be a wimp and quit stalling like nike would say just do it good bye people ive never met if anyone has a better way to a relatively painless death im open to suggestions sorry if this is against the rules but i just wanted to share my thoughts once with someone before i die hope everyone here has a better day than me edit im not so sad anymore today thank you for talking with me ill try harder to not let it happen again,1

feeling weirdly grateful for problems in my life the max income threshold to qualify for a local medical access program was lowered recently so i cant work the hours i needed to pay for discounted access to my psychiatrist and prescriptions i would qualify again if i dropped my college classes this semester if i stop taking my meds it will affect my grades and mental health obvs and i could have a manic episode around finals and waste the entire semester worsening my financial health anyway it was suggested i take out subsidized loans to pay for my mental health treatment so ive got that to look into but im oddly happy these problems suck but theyre a vast improvement over my past problems they show considerable progress in my life,0

ive barely been on today but all my post ideas have been very sad i am a shell of a human being,0
why growing up depressed is the worst thing ever tldr is at the bottom i am a male 14 year old boy btw i was born into a family without a father and my mother being a cop so that meant until i was about 910 my mom was constantly sleeping and working because she worked the night shift i spent those years developing no social skills and becoming a nervous wreck to make it more clear i built a stronger relationship with my dog than my mother then comes the day my mom decides to go back to college and quit her police job to spend more time with me this seems like a great idea to 9 year old but that was not the case my mom quit her job and was always very open about the financial position we were in this worry that overcame me when my 89 year old brain realized that money ruled the world caused me to view life in a more real way i like to pin the point where i realized money was the center of the world when my childhood endedsorry for getting off topic but if you guys know how much money college kids make then you know its hard to turn out real money and so this caused me to worry and be anxious around this time my mom moved me from the amazing state of louisianasarcasm to virginia to share a house with some old friends of hers virginia was painfully average but that was good to a 10 year old me having a nice home to go to and not to hear my mom worry about money made me happy then my mom got curious one day when her friends were out and one had left their phone the phone had messages from one of the old friends to the other that said hows the bitchmy mom doing and other stuff so for obvious reasons we moved back to louisiana but to a nicer neighborhood the nice neighborhood was nice when it came to crime rates and etc but the people were actual demons i mentioned before that i was anxious and felt worry about a lot of things so being bullied and manipulated didnt help i had a friend named harrynot his real name harry pretended to be my friend but he really just wanted to keep me from being friends with garretchill guy and obviously not his real name so it ended up being a thing where he would try to manipulate me by making me feel bad about myself and break promises i think ive been getting ages wrong in this story so far but he would cheat and grief in minecraft worlds where i worked hard in harry would also push me to the edge and make me lash out emotionally to the point where he would tell his parents that i was being mean to him this eventually went on until the 5th grade where i broke off him and garret moved away awhile after this so we wont see a return of harryhopefully he still does go to my school 5th grade brought a whole new challenge to my life that eventually made me have little to no self confidence i was accepted into gifted a different set of courses that you can get into if you have an iq above average i entered gifted at the end of the year so i didnt know what was going on in any subjects this led to me feeling like i was stupid although being in gifted and left me feeling like people were judging me for how many questions i asked so now by the time i enter 6th grade im unprepared depressed and anxious i havent mentioned my mom so far but she plays a big part of why my eyes see my life as a dumpster fire in 6th grade my grades never broke ds and cs this caused my mother to create a mindset in me where all the bad grades were my fault that i was always the problem that i had the potential to be the best to my 6th grad brain this was a lot of pressure and since my relationship with my mother worsened i unconsciously disobeyed her commands which caused her to blame me for more and more causing my self confidence to plummet and for me to constantly think that if i look sad than im looking for attention and that if i want someone to realize that im sad and to talk to me than im an attention seeking nerd i finally passed 6th grade but 7th grade was going to be the hardest challenge 7th grade is what confirmed my mindsets of feeling like i was never good enough and that i could never be above what i was now my mom continued to put me down which lowered my self esteem and self confidence to the point of true depression around this time i joined a robotics team that introduced me to my current friends which sounds good to an average teen but its quite the opposite these friends were nice but my mindset made me think that they constantly judged me and i always felt like i needed their approval so i tried to be the kid with dark humor to gain attention but it ended up with me diving further into depression at the end of 7th grade one of my friends told the school counselor that i looked and acted depressed after a few sessions i felt much better and talked to my mom about the problems which didnt go so well she yelled at me for explaining that she was the reason for a good bit of my depressive state she screamed dont you blame me for this after this point i developed a strong hatred for my mother we have fights close to everyday still eventually this ended and i went to 8th grade and my robotics friends went to 9th grade since theyre a bit olderi also had girl troubles that reversed the sessions with the counselors but ill speak about girls at the end 8th grade was the most average year in the past decade but i was still anxious awkward and depressed and i still fought with my mother girls zoinks bro the first hard crush i had on a girlwell call her girl1 developed after the sessions i had with the counselor i told some of my closest friends which included girl1s best friend so when i confessed to girl1 she responded with the rudest statement which was i know maybe you shouldnt tell your crushs best friend she then made this face and walked off the worst part is that i later found out that she was gay and none of her friends hinted to me that she wasnt interested i understand that being gay in some cases is a secret but someone couldve tipped me off so this instantly makes me feel that i couldnt fully trust anyonethis feeling had passed now after this i went awhile telling myself that i wasnt good enough for girls i wasnt good looking i was weird i was too awkward and i was too annoying recently i met another girl thats really cool shes bi likes music is in the same friend group and likes the same movies as me of course i feel as if she doesnt feel the same way as i do because she constantly walks away from me and has proven that she is more interested in my best friend than me shes given signs to my best friend that i havent experienced but girls are cool and all but tbh ill take a break from the whole dating scene if she doesnt feel the same for me thanks for hearing me out guys ill check back after breakfast tldr my life is filled with depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts because my life has been filled with constant worry manipulation bullying and a bad relationship with my mother,0

should i 21f tell my parents that my bf now ex 25 sexually violated me it happened over a year ago when i was still a virgin i snuck out of the house to see my boyfriend but before he came over i made it clear that i didnt want to take my shirt off and i didnt know if i wanted to do anything sexually yet i told him i strictly wanted him to come over so i could be in his presence and hang out and he said he understood he picked me up and we parked near a dark and quiet place we started to kiss and then he started to get kind of aggressive he pulled me by the hips to where he was then on top of me while he smashed his mouth onto mine at this point i was still so inexperienced and i thought this was just how makeout sessions were supposed to go so i stuck with it it wasnt until he put all of his body weight onto me and started tugging at my shirt to take it off that i started to freak out his face was still smashing mine so my verbal no stop were muffled i will never forget how in that moment i just laid there and was terrified i was going to be raped i said no and stop a couple more times until i finally had to kick him off of me i looked at him and said i think we should stop he gave me the ugliest glare and said oh so now you want to stop i felt so defeated and small i had no clue what to do he was making to seem like i baited him to come out there for a good time i specifically told him that i didnt want to take my shirt off and to not expect anything but he ignored that i started to feel like it was all my fault so i offered him head thinking back on that im so embarrassed i knew how uncomfortable hurt and scared i was in that moment but i naively offered to try to make him feel better he declined and drove me back home i just sat in my room and sobbed he sent me text after text telling me how he feels like he sexually assaulted me and how he wasnt raised like that he said his parents would be so disappointed in him and hes afraid im going to tell the cops the whole time i was consoling him and telling him that i didnt feel like i was raped or sexually assaulted so he didnt have to worry about it but to never let it happen again the next day he couldnt even go to work he was so shaken up and i couldnt even eat he profusely apologized and said he was in the wrong so i forgave him six months later we were completely fine and happy but we stumbled on the place where that night happened we sat there and he said that it wouldnt have happened if i didnt bait him there i kind of laughed because i thought he was kidding but he sat there and said he was dead serious he went on about how it was my fault and if i didnt want anything to happen then i shouldnt have come out i couldnt help but cry the rest of the way home i obviously dont want to do anything legally about it i just want to be able to release something that has been giving me anxiety lately is it even worth saying something to my parents or should i keep it to myself forever tldr should i even tell my parents that my bfnow ex almost sexually assaulted me im not sure how to even classify something like that i didnt feel and dont feel assaulted but i did and do feel violated its been weighing heavy on me lately and my parents are people i always run to when something is bothering me some backstory fast forward we arent together anymore his brother died he wouldnt see me for a whole year because he said he was depressed i tried to take a break from our relationship about three times when i felt completely hopeless and depressed but he would hit me with the wow my brother just died and youre really going to leave me so i felt stuck and stayed i would ask him every week for 8 months if he wanted to hang out but a few hours before we would be scheduled to meet he would cancel on me he canceled two hours before our anniversary didnt tell me happy birthday and would constantly tell me how the turmoil in our relationship was because i was not supportive and was self centered on the year mark of us not seeing each other because of the depression he felt after his brothers death i found out all this time he was curving me he was seeing his ex he even helped her with her new apartment by setting it up and buying her things we havent been officially together for a month now this was my first relationship and it was a very manipulative one it wasnt until my parents pulled me out of the relationship that i finally left,0

the cat and mouse game 24 f i met this interesting man on tinder 25 m we became friends initially he told me hes not interested in dating or getting into a relationship i shouldve been out after that just because i am looking for an actual relationship i like to be straightforward from the very beginning just so that i can avoid playing games like this and getting into messy situations what im dealing with now however i was sort of desperate at the time that i met him a year ago having no friends going through a rough time i decided okay lets be friends i couldnt resist my attraction for him at all though hes literally the embodiment of what i consider to be the perfect guy his looks personality the way we communicate etc i felt a deep connection to him i only get to see him once every couple of months however we usually texted like 247 getting into really deep intimate conversations with each other so the more i get to know himthe more i feel like i need to stop talking to him why well next up i find out that hes special ed has never been in a relationship before is jewish he put a huge emphasis on this part and we come from really different religious backgrounds his family life sounds hectic af but honestly i can relate to that part since my story to his is very similar look im an open minded person okay i seriously dont freaking mind that hes all of those things i consider myself just a normal kinda girl really ive been in plenty of relationships before long term ones usually and im very understanding and accommodating every time i see him in person i cant help but to fall deeper and deeper into something that feels very hard to come out of however he is the one that is continuously holding back i have a strong feeling that he feels the way i do i know there is a real connection between us or maybe im just delusional i dont know anymore the game has been non stop its becoming too much i dont know how he feels about me truly he considers me as a dear friend okay it hurts literally every other guy i know has no problem committing themselves to me hes playing soooo hard to get or maybe hes genuinely not interested in that way he wants to know every sexy detail about me though i just dont get it subtly flirting with me but never going anywhere really i feel like hes just leading me on playing with my feelings and emotions at this point its a new years ive wasted a year talking to someone thatll never lead to anything more huge waste of my time i need to get back into the dating world since i put this aside after meeting him okay and maybe start again however the only problem now is that its hard letting go of this all i dont fucking know what to do he cant seem to let go of me either but i cant keep playing this game he drains all of my energy if i were to find another guy that would mean my energy goes to him this is why its hard for me to let go even worse ive fallen deeply in love with this man i feel like i genuinely understand him its unfortunate though were just friends but sometimes it doesnt feel that way i dont know what to believe part of me wants to confess already and move on with my effing life the other part is stuck and doesnt want to make a move otherwise everything gets destroyed wtf do i do tldr,0
leaving a butt plug in for too long im sure this has probably been posted more than once but its far too embarrassing to tell a single person i know so let me tell thousands of people i dont know instead like any good couple my boyfriend and i like to get a little kinky from time to time nothing too major but i wouldnt always call our sex life vanilla you know so when we got home after walking the dog and he told me to put my butt plug in i obliged without a second thought weve been using it for a couple of weeks now and i havent had a single problem with it i put the plug in and we carried on with our night i had honestly completely forgotten that it was in there until i guess a couple of hours later when it started to feel sore figuring that it was just aching from being in there for so long i went to go take it out to my horror of course the flared end of the plug had wedged itself inside of me i could feel the very end of it so i pushed my fingers inside and tried to hook them around the end of the plug in order to pull it out this is where i really fucked up not only are my nails much too long right now but in my attempt to remove the plug i somehow managed to push it even deeper inside of me my fingertips couldnt feel the base anymore and i knew that if i tried to pull it out i would either make it worse by pushing it in deeper still or i would end up scratching myself with my nails which left my with two options the first option was to rush to the emergency room it wasnt even so much the embarrassment of having to have the plug extracted from my asshole by a doctor or nurse that scared me as much as it was the questions my parents would ask we asked to use their car to go to the hospital so that was out of the question the second option was to run downstairs and ask my boyfriend to remove it it would save me the embarrassment of having a third party present but i knew he had would have no idea what to do hes not a doctor and theres a chance that he could push it in deeper too make it worse somehow i decided i would take my chances and ran downstairs into the basement i tugged him into the bedroom and immediately removed my pants before he could ask any questions i choked out its stuck his face went from confusion to realization in a matter of seconds he far too quickly sprung into action and with something of a miracle on my side and a shit ton of lube he was able to remove it after a little bit he later told me that it was horizontally inside of me prodding at what i assume to be my bowels tldr my boyfriend and i decided to use a butt plug i left it in for too long it got lost inside of me and he had to take it out,0

dept of labor contradiction i was debating a friend of mine about the wage gap and went off to do my research i found a white paper study from the department of labor url written in 2009 that ends with the conclusion as a result it is not possible now and doubtless will never be possible to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men differently on socially acceptable bases and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women in addition at a practical level the complex combination of factors that collectively determine the wages paid to different individuals makes the formulation of policy that will reliably redress any overt discrimination that does exist a task that is at least daunting and more likely unachievable however in 2012 the dept of labor posted a blog posturl effectively recanting the conclusions of the aforementioned paper what is one supposed to conclude from all of this is there a more reliable source for information on the wage gap thanks,0
rant about shit life yeyso i really want to end my life everyday i wake upeat and play videogames my grades are shit and if my mother find out about them im going to get in serious trouble i can handle the hitting and her taking away my phone but i cant stand being screamed at im so terrified of exams i literally text other girls in my class to send me the answers to the homework and i barely understand anything my sister is silently judging me because i keep asking her to give me homework answers i barely talk to my friends about anything outside of school most of the days we ignore each other and they have other friends and i always ruin my relationships with other people because of what i define as morals so i know its my fault things are like that but i just feel so lonely and each time i try talking to someone online i just sound retarded af i stopped doing the only hobby that i enjoy because i dont get noticed by other people and its almost like its forgotten and i eat so much shit that i look like harry from harry and the fucking hendersons and im not willing to do anything about it because theres no point if i get i fail or get anything less than 90 then im going to do it the only actual reason thats keeping me from doing it is because i dont want to end up in hell but im not a good person and i have the morals of a prostitute so either way im going to spend eternity with satan this post was useless and apparently i cant talk about how i feel without sounding like a person with a single digit iq i pray to god and sincerely hope that the next time im falling asleep is my last time,1

anyone thought of purposefully getting infected by the virusmy life has steadily gone down hill the past few years after experiencing extreme physical and mental trauma from abusive relationships ive always been opposed to life not necessarily suicidal just tried to find little things about the future to keep me going i moved to a new state six months ago with my fiance almost immediately we lost our jobs and our already unhealthy relationship took a turn for the worst and he abandoned me to go back home to maine i fought like hell to pick myself back up and for the first time in my life i was truly happy with who i was and being alone fast forward a few months later i got swept up in a relationship with the most loving caring person ive ever met i self destructed that relationship tonight because i dont know how to communicate and push people away i have been both mentally and physically abused in my past relationships before this man and i dont know how to be in a healthy relationship anymore if i ever did every moment with him was pure bliss and now that ive experienced a relationship like that im ready to go i lost my job because of the virus im alone in a state with no family or friends my current living situation is hell and honestly what has pushed me over the edge my roommate is verbally and mentally abusive daily i cant even get back to my family on the opposite coast if i wanted to and id be terrified of infecting them ive dreamed for years and years now what i would do it if things ever got this bad now i feel like i have a socially acceptable easy way out i could be just like rest of the victims dying and my family would think it happened naturally i just have no reason to live anymore and i dont want to ive fought for so long and so hard and now all im left with is debt ptsd no hope for the future of my industry thats collapsing i just dont want to exist anymore im a high risk patient so i dont think it would be terribly hard to catch if i want to a couple hospitalsdr officesplaces where people are blatantly ignoring social distancing im currently sick with strep have severe asthma and scar tissue in my lungs from almost getting wiped out as a kid as i watch the death tolls rise im sleeping outside tonight so as to avoid my roommate and its already pretty chilly i only have a thin blanket and foolishly left the house in shorts i dont believe in god but fuck ill pray to him if he lets me go to sleep and never let my eyes open im so terribly ashamed of how i treated a sweet amazing man who didnt deserve it my plan is to try and get myself infected and and sleep in a tent out in the wilderness for 2 weeks if i havent caught it yet ill try again just to make sure im not asymptomatic and infecting innocent people damn it feels good to have a plan that will let my family grieve and know this will all be over soon i know this option isnt for everyone but i am so terribly ready,1

im 15 and ruined my life my only option is to die and i cant do that so in january 2015 i found out i could force days off school then the day after that faked tearing my thigh muscle and managed to get a month off school then when that month ended i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which made me have even more time off making it even harder to get back afterwards although for the rest of that year at school 7 i managed to keep an ok attendance and everything was working out then in july 2015 i started to drop off with managing my diabetes which then caused me to lose motivation then in september 2015 i had another month off school that was the first time i felt suicidal although that didnt last long and everything except my diabetes which got way way worse started to improve until after christmas in january i had another month off school which caused me to officially drop out in february which is when everything started to fall apart i started pushing away my at the time girlfriend became essentially a hermit let my diabetes get worse and basically did everything in my power to make myself worse 2 months later i lost 3 of my 4 best friends the one i didnt lose being my ex then just preceded to feel sorry for myself for the next 3 months when i became friends with someone i used to hate whos now my co best friend co with my ex after that nothing changed until january 2017 when i decided to try and get back to school that didnt work out at all and i just got worse afterwards after that nothing changed until june when i started being even more of a wanker to my at the time girlfriend by stopping talking to her and carried on doing that until october when i started talking to her again in december we got back together and i got a job although me and her only lasted throughout december in january i badly injured my foot which got infected gave me sepsis and nearly killed me typical of my luck that it didnt and i quit my job not long afterwards in march i got back with my ex and i stopped pushing her away but still wasnt anything close to a proper boyfriend but between march and may was the best period of time ive had for years and in may someone kissed her and that was the final nail in the coffin between us in that way although were still best friends but it got to the point where the last thing keeping me going was me and her and now its gone ive lost all hope because nothings fixable anymore but im too fucking pathetic to even kill myself i went out to jump in front of a car which sounds stupid but still and i didnt even have the balls to do it and i dont know what to do because i cant go back and fix things no matter how much i wish i could and i cant and i cant end it but at the same time i cant carry on because im basically dead anyway all i do is listen to music and watch movies,1

an invitation hi im not really sure if i should be doing this but here goes im here to say that if anyone reading this would like to vent about something and get a random stranger on the internet opinions on it i am here i am not a therapist but i am a good listener im not trying to get your money and im not trying to trick you the inspiration for me posting this comes from today i have been suicidal for years but continue to stick around for my family and tonight was the first time i ever reached out for help i contacted 3 online crisis lines which quite frankly made me feel even worse one operator could barley even hold a discussion another essentially hung up on me and the other told me the service cost 200 a month i feel like people like us who read these subreddits are not going find use in those services so perhaps a real discussion with a human could help in a strange way i find listening to others problems and trying to offer insight helpful to my own health so if you are interested then let me know,1

getting to know people for podcast hey guys so im interested in starting a podcast later this year probably late august early september and i want it to be like a group thing like the mcelroy brothers for example not the same content just the group dynamicidea this isnt an audition at all but i think it would be great to find a group that all fits well together and wants to do something like this in their free time i dont want to seem exclusionary in this at all like i said not an audition at all because this will be way unprofessional as far as podcasts go but i didnt know if anyone else was interested in ever finding a group of 3 5 people to host a podcast with and wanted to work with me to find said group im sure that this post is starting to sound snobbier as i go on and that isnt my intention in the slightest so im going to stop now while im ahead this has just been a goal of mine for a while and i figured you guys are all nice and cool and would be fun to talk to and location doesnt matter at all everyone could skype or something and record it and i can teach myself how to put together a decent sounding audio this would be for fun and experience and friendship so its most likely something you would want to do if youre very interested in something like this,0
i just want it all to be overi just wish i could die and all the pain would finally end as long as i can remember ive always been treated like less than a person in elementary school i hated waking up in the morning because i knew sooner or later someone and their friends would decide to harass me as an example i remember once i was playing at recess and a group of four kids started throwing rocks and acorns at me even dirt which would get into my mouth because they would throw it into my face then i tried to run away and they followed me wherever i went so i tried hiding up on a slide jungle gym of sorts and they just continued harassing me and even wouldnt let me down but as soon as i tried to defend myself they ran to a teacher and would you like to know what i heard from her why should i believe your story over these 4 boys so basically on a weekly basis my parents would be getting calls for the school about how i started a fight with other students then i would be sent to the principles office to be physically assaluted for trying to defend myself if i beat someone with a stick for trying to stop a rape i would go to prison but apparently its ok for adults to beat kids who are only trying to defend themselves from being stalked outside during recess and have dirt thrown in their mouth as a sick joke that went on from kindergarten until 5th grade after that it was usually harassment about my weight my red hair and glasses or how because i and a friend always hung out together we must be gay when i would go home from all of this every day i would be told i was a liar if i tried to tell the truth and im firmly convinced my dad just didnt give a crap about what was going on because all he would ever do is scream at me and hit me he didnt once listen when i would ask for help you know and the funny thing is i thought after i finally got out of school i might be able to be myself and the harassment would end nope ive been out of hs for 3 years now ive had about 13 jobs because no matter where i go there is a member of management who enjoys making every moment there a living hell for everyone so after a few months of putting up with them constantly complaining about everything i finally snap and quit my first job i had for 2 years and it was a daily thing to be asked why dont you care about your job when you are only trying to do your best the manager would never offer any help or try to tell you an easier way to do something nothing but negativity sometimes he would make up things that he told you to do already and then tell you you were a bad employee for not doing them if ive been here for a year and never been told to do this why am i suddenly going to start doing it unless you tell me i had another manager cuss at me because i had to change my schedule starting 2 weeks from the day i notified him etc aside from that its like everywhere i go people want to insult and belittle me at every turn i just want to go to work to make money this isnt supposed to be a high school the only job i ever had that i like was at ut arlington library because i was actually able to go to work and do my job without interference from people who just want to bitch about literally anything they can think of constantly and it was so quiet there im sick and tired of this i just wish i could kill myself i just want to be treated like a person instead of a piece of garbage i just go home every day from the harassment alone and i lay in my bed all night wishing someone was there to hold my hand the only relationship ive ever had was 2 years filled with emotional abuse in high school i was made to feel like i wasnt good enough and she used to torment me by refusing to even acknowledge me sometimes then i would do everything to get back on her good side so that she would treat me with love again the next day but then it would repeat and repeat and repeat for the entire two years i finally cut it off once she started referring to me as her brother to fuck with me emotionally we couldnt even have a conversation without her going off the deep end about something and then trying to make me feel like shit about it she would even cry if i didnt want to talk about a certain topic about myself that made me uncomfortable because she believed everything was her buissness but i miss having someone hold my hand so badly i miss being touched and kissed i miss it so much no matter what i do nobody ever wants me i just want someone to care i just want a hug my last job was as a dominos pizza delivery driver and i loved it the first one ive liked since the library job and i made 6000 in 3 months of working there so the money was great i usually made 700 every month if i was lucky at most of my jobs minimum wage jobs rarely guarantee full time hours and getting a second job is impossible when the first one expects you to be available at any time and never gives you a set schedule but then a customer followed me 5 miles back to the store and started verbally harassing me at the store because i and btw i wasnt riding the tail of his car apparently was riding his ass while driving what actually happened was the guy was sitting at a green light like a dumbness and then when he finally moved he was going a full 25mph in a 45mph zone rather than get stuck behind another red light i followed closely because hes hardly moving and so after we leave the intersection im of course going to go around so its not a dangerous situation well before we even get out of the intersection he slams on his breaks almost making me hit him it wasnt that hard to avoid actually there was about 5 feet between our cars and we were going maybe 25 and before he does anything else i just drive to the right and go around while im looking in my mirror and going the speed limit i see the recede behind me but then after a few seconds the guy start to gain on me so obviously speeding i didnt really think anything of it until i made a turn off the road and he followed me so i made a few more and low and behold im being followed so i got back to the store and the guy started harassing me in front of management i stopped the interaction and told the manager i wasnt going to deal with this since my shift had actually been scheduled to end a half hour ago and if they didnt cash me out i was quitting right there so there goes another job im just about read to call in the cards on this life,1

recently started dating my best friend of 12 years anyone else in the same boat tldr so the title pretty much says it all who else has done this ive 33f recently started dating my best friend 32m of 12 years weve always had a very obvious attraction to each other but until recently never really acknowledged it past flirting when we get drunk only ever when we have both been single a bit if background we have always got on really well have an incredibly open relationship and can talk about anything there is never any sort of judgement or embarrassment we have had periods of time where we have lost contact i put it like that as it has always stemmed from one of us having a partner that dislikesfeels threatened by our friendship and have decided to ban us from talking to each other side note it never actually worked because first and foremost we have an incredibly strong friendship and though it would be far less often we would still always find ways to check in with each other there have also always been lots of convenient excuses were both already with people or at least one of us is we dont want to ruin our friendship and mostly we were just scared to actually face up to it so we have recently the last month or so actually faced it and decided to give it a go its a really strange thing going from just friends to being openly affectionate with each other but at the same time seems like the most natural thing ever mutual friends and his mum have all seemed to breathe a collective sigh of relief that weve finally got together no pressure or anything has anyone else been in this boat what were the best and more importantly worst bits of it for you,0

i made this throwaway for totally different purposes but before i log out now i figure i should use it to get some more personal thoughts out i just fucking hate the fact that someone can turn your entire life upside down overnight make you question your own existence and suffer zero consequences for it talking about my scumbag of a dad who built his life on the lie that hes straight when he selfadmittedly knew he wasnt and now im supposed to just play along with his plan for a happy little stepfamily after hes gotten everything he ever wanted kids from his fake marriage a new boyfriend by using people for his own personal gain but im the one thats meant to accept and forgive deal with the emotional fallout of his lies and the divorce while he walks away blameless having knowingly and purposefully deceived everyone close to him for decades because his life is just so hard of course like no one elses who never turned out a total douchebag the worst part isnt my dads betrayal though its having literally no one around me for support my entire family is acting like we have to walk on eggshells around dad and they seem to be suffering from collective amnesia about his decades long fraud even mom ironically the only person who has shown me sympathy is lgbt herself anyhow i just had to vent because a lot has been on my mind these past few weeks and today has been especially shitty ive been crying uncontrollably for the past hour i just feel like everythings falling apart and in the end everyone thinks im just another ungrateful teenage brat and my dads brave for being authentic i dont really have a conclusion im going to try and fall asleep now that my chest feels a bit lighter kinda been wanting to post for awhile actually but im too tame to use my main handle for this so hi i guess,1

i got blindsided today context my first post and im on mobile so yesterday i made a deal withy grandpa that we would go to a bookstore and select the book and that day i woke up at 12 pm but decided to wait till like 3pm so i did that so we went to the car the beginning so when we drove to the bookstore it was in another city like 20 km l was just sitting in the back seat bored so i waited and so to pass time me and my grandpa were talking along with my brothers and there were lots of accidents on the way mind you this is saudi arabia in ramadan in the afternoon we eventually reached there and we took quite a while so then we were choosing our book btw i chose harry potter and the philosophers stoneim already on page 71 and i chose it early while my brothers took quite a while so i decided to go to the gaming section this bookstore has more than books it sells electronics and accessories cuz im a 12 yo and finally we are done we came at 4 we left 530 and we pay the accident so we were going normally and part of this route is to turn in to a apartment neighborhood idk but there was this little truck it was like a pickup truck but with a longer back thing and the storage thingcant find photos and it was parking on the left side of the street and changed its mind to go right and rammed into us and at this moment we are just casual and then we here a bang noise like a really loud one and the car kind of gets lifted on the side my lil bro thought we were about to flip i was freaking shocked and scared so i was like getting my mind together on what happened then i realized what just happened and then my granddad went out to check the damage and the guy from the truck came out looking like he was in the verge of tears and they and my grandpa went out to deal with it and someone who was behind the accident stopped and helped and after 5 min someone else came and by 20 min there was a croud of 7 people and i asked to see the damage and boy was it bad i had a photo but it disappeared and the door had a huge dent mark and the little thing under the door was detached the car that we were in was a toyota rav4 2018 the conclusion the car rn is getting fixed and yep,0

is he m27 cheating im a girl that isnt looking for anything serious at the moment i got out of an 8 year relationship almost 2 years ago and still enjoy being single for the time being i met a man off tinder over year ago we agreed to be fuck buddies but never slept together on the first date because i didnt want to drop my pants without knowing the guy a bit we had a great first date filled with lots of kissing after that time we never met again this was december 2017 he ghosted me i flaked on him a lot and that was the cycle for all of 2018 hed compliment me a lot and try making plans but i was busy when i wasnt busy he was busy but i didnt care much for him other than finding him very attractive and fun every month hed message me and reply to my instagram stories to remind me hes still alive id do that to him every once in a while too haha i just found this whole silly game funny and never took anything seriously now the issue he wanted to meet up with me in december 2018 but the plan was never implemented i posted a modest nude of myself on new years eve which he responded to saying damn i want to see more of you in the new year happy new year cutie keep up the in 2019 i said haha we keep flaking on one another though and he said just waiting for the right time i guess hours later he posted videos of him and this girl at a formal new years eve party i know this girl has been a hook up for him for over a year but he never started posting her till november of last year clearly this man is a player i know this but i also dont care anyways hes been posting many things with this girl in january since they have been clearly spending most days of the week together and he doesnt mind showing her off which is cute he bootycalled me about 3 weeks ago which i was surprised about because i thought this girl was a gf or just someone he was planning on getting serious with i rejected the booty call by saying i only sleep with people i know well and vibe with and i dont know you well im sure youll be able to find someone tonight have so much fun and he said i did thank you have fun cutie a couple weeks later he posted cute valentines videos with her it seemed like the got super serious about 2 weeks ago and be booty called me 3 weeks ago they spend so much time together and shes constantly in his posts he views all my stories i post religiously still but never likes any of my new pics anymore like he use to tldr if hes not satisfied with the girl why is he dating her i think hes just a shit person but maybe hes still single i know he cares for her as a friend but he barely knows me and booty called me so idk if hes cheating or just has a fwb he likes to show the world hes dating now but never showed her face before,0

i am tired so this is just a vent post i dont need any advice or anything at all but if you read this ily when i was like just learning how to walk i broke my left leg once and also broke my right leg 3 months later which got fixed and i had to get a fracture i dont even remember this but this proves that i have weak bones since the beginning now im a regular happy and healthy child it was normal day at school and my pe teacher told all of the kids to race i was 5 in 1st grade i was at 2 nd place during the race and another girl who wanted to take my place made me fall by sticking her leg infront of mine i didnt fall very hard but i hit the ground at such an angle that i broke my femur longest bone located at thigh i was sent to the hospital in an ambulance service provided by my school and had to get a rod placed inside my leg and i was on bed rest for 6 months this forced me to get study material from my friends and i went to give the important exams like mid term and finals with a walker then it was the time to get the plate removed and i was on bed rest for 6 months again i was in the early stages of recovery and limped while walking just three months after the surgery my father was going to buy something from the departmental store and i begged to go with him as i hadnt gone anywhere except my school in the last year but unfortunately a drunk idiot in a car hit us after this accident i was on the road crying as i wasnt able to get up my father somehow managed to get me to hospital this is where we found out that i had broken the same bone again just a little lower than the last one i had to go through the same cycle of getting the plate added and removed 1 year things started to get better but i was permanently scared of falling from now on and my family was emotionally scarred because of the things we had to go through when i was 11 we shifted to another city to get better medical treatment for me because i limped all the time we went to a chiropractor he was helping me do some knee ups and i randomly fainted i woke up 2 minutes later and we visited the doctor and i found out that i had torn my ligament i had to be on bed rest for 3 months after three months i started to walk a little bit after that i was at my aunts for dinner or something and the floor was wet and i slipped and fell on my knees which again tore my knee ligament the same fucking bullshit again finally it had been three years age 15 and nothing had happened to me obviously i gained weight due to so much bed rest and being unable to move i got diagnosed with pcod i immediately started going to the gym and followed a strict diet and guess what i fell again because some kid in my building had left his toys on the stairs i broke my femur yet again this time my family decided to go with im nail surgery this happened last year and i still have the nail in my leg i keep thinking about this and i just keeps me up a night i missed my whole childhood i missed school i had to give exams from home i still scored straight as and my teachers motivated me i think that i am a burden for my family i really want to kill myself sometimes i always injured my left leg so it is extremely weak i limp all the time so people give me weird looksand if youre still reading this thank you form the bottom of my heart thank you,0

my 21f relationship with my boyfriend 22m is starting to feel to me like its stagnating i dont know if its just my depression coloring things or if i need to seriously look at changing our relationship status sorry in advance for the long post ill try and make this as objective and coherent as i can my boyfriend and i have been together for 7 months and weve been friends for even longer weve been happy for most of that and when the relationship started i was over the moon it was all sneaking away for a quick kiss weekends together i love you texts multiple times a day calling each other every night etc etc so on and so forth at first we kind of had to keep our relationship on the downlow because we met at work but we never worked togetherwe worked completely different shifts at an ambulance company so its not like we were seeing each other 8 hours a day five days a week where we couldnt act like a couple there were some bumps but there are in every relationship plus this is my first relationship and his first serious relationship so my mantra through all this has been were figuring it out together and it has rung true for quite a while but the honeymoon phase is pretty much over now and i dont know what i think anymore i know i love him but i dont know if our long term goals are going to be compatible i dont even know if he knows what his long term goals are our schedules have both changed ive moved jobs and hes changed shifts and at most we get less than 24 hours together every week the calls have died down and the texts and snapchats are a lot less fluffy and gooey not that i particularly mind that im definitely not great with being open and emotional i think maybe the spark is gone but its very hard to tell i know for sure the physical spark isnt gone though there are lots of complicated factors here the first and biggest one is that i have moderate to severe depression and ive been in a pretty bad slump lately im working with my doctor to adjust meds and get in touch with a therapist but for right now im really struggling to feel happy or much of anything really im lonely a lot but its not either of our faults and i knew from the getgo that my mental health might make things difficult another thing is that we live an hour away from each other by car that doesnt sound like much i know but i think its hard to be halflong distance half not getting our own apartment together is not a feasible goal right now as im headed back to college to prep for nursing school and we both agree its a step too far for now i live with my aunt and he lives with his parents so either way we rarely have time to ourselves outside of locking ourselves in a bedroom together and it really honestly puts a damper on our sex life it doesnt affect me much my sex drive hasnt ever really been crazy and the antidepressants dont help i can and do get in the mood but i dont really care that much if we dont have sex and i dont feel the need to give myself pleasure so to speak when hes not there weve gotten a hotel room in the past to get away for a while and have an upcoming hotel stay booked but that doesnt happen often my boyfriend has honestly been amazing despite all this hes patient and loving and has never pressured me into doing something i dont want to do he takes no for an answer if and when i change my mind about anything he has never made me feel anything but safe and secure with him around his mother definitely raised him right and im lucky he chose me we rarely fight and when we do its often very quickly resolved i cant stay mad at him for long i just love him too much so honestly i dont know what i want to do here i dont want to break up with him but i dont want either of us to feel like were settling i dont know how to bring this change up i know the strongest relationships are the steady patient ones and not necessarily the younglove firework type love if that makes sense but theres a difference between steady strong and just falling out of love i understand that love is a choice and im trying to choose it but i dont know if its working and i might be the only one who feels this way for all i know to him everything is peachy and still amazing how do i revive my relationship how do i make the changes that need to be made in order for us to not just exist but thrive together how do i even bring this up im just so lost and confused and i know i tend to be pessimistic at times sometimes i can see us lasting for years and sometimes i dont know if well even make it to a year any advice or guidance helps thank you guys so much in advance tldr i love my boyfriend but there are a lot of obstacles in our relationship i dont know if well be able to overcome but i know im not thinking with a clear head right now due to a depression flare up and i dont know how to communicate that or change it,0

the fact that your brain wants you to die but your body will do anything to survive is bullshitno matter how hard you try its all pointless because for some reason your brain is dead set on feeling like the worst shit possible by default if you start to feel better for even just a little while it will all come crashing back down again so you feel worse than you did before why do some people have mental illness and others dont why are others fine and do i have to be put on meds not even to be fine but to not feel anything what fucking genius created life and decided some people just arent allowed to have the freedom of a mind thats not constantly telling them that itd be better if theyre just dead in a world where the majority of people are inconsiderate judgemental knowitalls who want to decide for you that what youre feeling isnt a reason to kill yourself,1

waiting for this day to happen imagine it 9pm outside i am walking home i stop at a convenience store to get a drink i stare at the drinks and pretend like i am having a hard time choosing one even though i know what i am getting two guys with a ski mask on come into the store and start shouting one says get the fuck down bitch to me i am inside thinking this is my lucky day i get up try to fuck with them they shoot me that simple no other shit like omg he killed himself or wow he was suicidal simple he got killed at the convenience store done i dont have friends girlfriend or any one close just my family3 they will have much better time coping with my death my enemies and competitors will throw their hats to the sky and have a lit party and dance hype all day my aunts and uncles throw a party and celebrate the day they have been waiting for maybe i should just take my brother with me he is gonna go thru the same shit as me i know it he will need a help and a guidance it will be hard for him without me if wemy bro and i leave then my parents will be better financially since they always says they do all this hard work for us and stuff if we are just gone then it will be easier for them they dont have to try hard to raise us they will just mind their own business and simple i mean why the fuck did they have sex and made us if they were going to say this everyday i gave birth to you so i can kill you or do what ever i want to you or i am suffering financially to put a roof over your head just stop it then like you dont have to i mean what the fuck is this life am i born to make money wtf i go to school for 12 years just so that i can make money in the future life is meaningless its stupid what the fuck is food if we did not eat food then we would be fine not working our ass off for we can literally go ahead and do our favorite shit without worrying about anything i mean what is the point of living with stress and pressure to chase money in the next 50 years when you can just get rid of all that today or very soon if i were to live next 50 years i still will be having stress and problems everyday it an unfair world stupid pointless money can buy anything no one gives a fuck about how hard you work money can buy that shit ps i dont own a gun but i really want one so i can gtfo here oh btw i am a pile of poo and i cant do shit,1

a pale blue dot this might not resonate with everyone who reads it but ive recently been involved with astronomy and astrophysics for about a year and there is something which ive realised on the philosophical side of it 1 we are abandoned in a meaningless universe to find meaning for ourselves 2 we are just specks of stardust on a big rock 3 there are innumerable numbers of stars planets blackholes galaxies anomalies out there and still we are so bothered by the frivolous things in life 4 the mere thought of finding extraterrestrial organisms in space will unify humans 5 its both horrifying and satisfying to think that nothing matters in the grand scheme of cosmos a pale blue dot,0

kicking my girlfriends mum in the face first i would like to state this was not today my bad but i thought it was too good not to share with you secondly she is not my girlfriend anymore supprisingly anyways i used to always sleep at my ex girlfriends parents house we where 1718 at the time at her mum and dad where quite strictbatshit crazy so we used to go out at the weekend and get wasted from alcohol and other things best left off here and she would sneak me into her house so we could you know do stuff as me and her parents didnt get on i would usually leave early before they woke up this went on for about 6 months and being a total master desguise i managed to get caught a total of 2 maybe 3 times the last time i got caught of course happened to be the incident in which i am describing to u today she caught me ravaging her daughter and went totally unreasonably mental so after kicking off at her daughter not much was said to me she stormed downstairs me having an impeccable judgment decide it was best to leave but not downstairs where she was lerking but out of her sisters bedroom windows i know what you are thinking what a brilliant idea who wouldnt think of that so i kiss my then girlfriend goodbye and make it heroically out of the windows and down onto the im going to call it a balcony but its more just like a concrete slab that rested above the front door i was far too hungover for just jumping down from the im guessing around 9 foot drop so i decided to grip the edge of the slab with my hands and lower myself down slowly and use my kind of swing myself down onto the grassy area of her front garden making it an easy landing so i lower myself down and start to swing my legs backward and forwards so i could jump behind me onto the grass and avoid the steps beneath the door but as i swung no wore that 3 times as i was about to to make my gallant jump her mother opened the door and step onto the first step bang yup i kicked her in the face with both feet i basically drop kicked this withered old hag and knocked her strait onto her back i literally just dropped down took a moment to pause and ran like hell i was hoping it all happened so fast that she didnt see me but suprise she did she was fine other than a couple of stitches but regardless i got dumped tldr got horny and got caught by girlfriends mum who went crazy i escaped out of the windows drop kicking my girlfriends mother on the way down then got dumped,0
just needed to get my thoughts out cant take this life anymore im done i dont want to be here anymore i just cant stand it ive been dealing with extremely severe physical symptoms of anxiety for years now and im positive it cannot be just anxiety there must be something wrong with me but no doctors are willing to give me a chance they all just blame it on stress sleep anxiety etc i just cant take it anymore i cant remember the last time i truly felt 100 normal present all there theres always something wrong my brain feels empty or my head feels like its going to explode my body feels numb or frigid or burning hot its all wrong i dont even feel real anymore i keep hoping one day ill wake up and somehow ill feel okbut sadly i know this is just a fantasy every therapist ive ever seen has been totally useless they all just say to journal practice mindfulness yogathanks tell me something i dont know i used to look forward to things handing out with friends vacations activitiesnow i find it so hard to work up the energy to do anything because i just feel like shit all the time physically and mentally i think about killing myself almost constantly i really like to take late night walks and these are especially inspiring seeing all the cars fly by just makes me want to hurl myself in front of one but i know that this unfortunately isnt a surefire way to go the speed limit is pretty low and i feel like the only thing that could make life worse is if i survived an attempt but was confined to a wheelchair or something i was feeling particularly low today and went to buy razor blades but sadly the store was closed but the whole time all i could think about was how much i wanted to die and what if i didnt waste my time cutting but what if i just threw myself in front of that bus or just laid down in the middle of the road and waited i guess thats really it i dont know how much longer ill last and theres a lot more to my story but i obviously cant write it all here thanks,1
i shifted focus so ive been depressed for a long time a lot of shit happened and is still happening plus i have a few diagnosed illnesses and of course the classic suicidal thoughts ive tried to take my life by pills 3 times always failed to actually die now i shifted my focus in life can you really call it that i realized that with my experience i can help people and i think they noticed a lot of even old friends hit me up asking me for advice wanting to meet up for a hug and a looooong talk some even confessing to also wanting to commit suicide as dumb as that may sound the only thing to give me satisfaction is knowing that i just helped someone doesnt matter to what degree ive already saved a few people and ill keep it going no matter how i get myself because id rather fade away knowing i at least had some impact try it talk to the people and try to help them as best as you can maybe youll also be able to hold on a bit longer with a purpose like that give the help you want to receive much love to everyone on here,1

update i 19f have a crush on one of my regular customers 2224m original url hi everyone so im back from my last post not really with an update but more a new dilemma its been 2 months since i started crushing on customer boy and the feelings are still fkn there but for some reason i just cannot bring myself to ask him out the last few weeks especially though ive started having actual conversations with him and im certain he is flirting back with me now i know hes interested but i just cant seem to do it however i met this other guy a couple of weeks ago and have been on two dates with him and have been texting him non stop and i reallllly really really like him and get along with him so well and we have so much in common but for some reason ive still got coffee guy at the back of my mind i found out since my last post what coffee guy does for a job and what his hobbies are and he is literally the polar opposite to me when it comes to interests to say the least but every time he comes in i get so giddy and nervous and smiley what do i do reddit i could probably just pursue things with this other guy and it would go really well i think but its bugging me to think that there might be something amazing there with coffee boy and i dont even know it tldr still head over heels for coffee boy but have started seeing a new guy who i really like and get along with,0

im ending my life tomorrow hi i never thought id post on here i dont even know where to begin im 22 ive suffered from depression for as long as i can remember and have had suicidal thoughts since i was 10 i believe i have bpd but it hasnt been diagnosed ive attempted suicide a handful of times but never succeeded mostly because i wasnt 100 committed to the idea i dont have a bad life im not close to my family but were not estranged either my parents love me but didnt really know how to handle my emotional issues and i never got the help i needed when i was a child so ive been trying to play catch up on my own since ive had access to resources medications dont work therapy doesnt work meditation doesnt work healthy diet and exercise doesnt work im at a loss for what to do i was bullied severely as a child and i thought once that stopped id be happy but i wasnt then i was fighting with my parents all the time and i thought once i moved out and went to college id be happy i wasnt i went to school for 3 years but then dropped out because my depression got in the way i lost all my friends and my apartment and i recently had to move back home since the beginning of this year ive moved back in with my parents my car has broke down for the third time ive started a miserable job ill probably be stuck in the rest of my life and worst of all this week i lost my best friend of 7 years she was the most important person in my life my soulmate shes cut off all contact with me and i dont blame her i was so motivated at the start of this year to be a better person but without her by my side i dont want to be anything all the color has drained from the world i cant eat i cant sleep and its not her fault i feel this way its the realization that im such a terrible person that the best friend ive ever known whos been there through thick and thin who just the night before she stopped talking to me was telling me how everything was going to be okay could completely cut me off i hurt her so bad that all the promises of our future together are no more and i cannot forgive myself for that im going to make an exit bag but a real shitty one since i have no car to go get supplies i only have stores i can walk to available to me i just so happened to find out i have the day off work tomorrow so my parents will leave me at home alone before they go off to work ill then go pick up my supplies and come home and hopefully within the hour ill be gone i dont know why im writing this out i guess i want to tell someone it seems weird to die and just not say goodbye so goodbye if it doesnt work or i change my mind ill update by saturday night and let everyone know if i dont update youll know it worked i just want to urge anyone out there whos thinking of suicide please dont do it i know i sound like a hypocrite but one day everythings going to work out for you no matter what youre dealing with the world wouldnt be the same without you in it im sure after im gone there will be people who will wish i hadnt done it but im being selfish i dont want to suffer anymore dont make my same mistake thank you for taking the time to read my post its good to know my final thoughts will be read by someone,1

i have lost all my important friendships i am sorry if this is long ever since i was a teenager i have struggled with finding friends i am 27 or 28 in a month happily i found a few close friends through my current education social work not to mention a distant close friend 300 km away i have had since i was 16they are all wonderful people but in the middle of my education severe anxiety problems came to me not the first time but now i had more people around my life who werent used to it and neither was i used to having reallife friends i can confide in but apparantly i took this too far i hurt them all in different ways but ultimately it was because of my incessant need to reach out when i am anxious one of them told me to never speak to her again two others just stopped answering when i write to them the first mentioned hurts the most we wrote our bachelor thesis together we couldnt finish it the first semester in july so we had to finish it in the second instead in january i feel i am mostly to blame but i honestly do not know all i know is that i took all the blame she thinks i am thoroughly selfish it is a messy story and the more i think about it the less i know the truth of it all now they are gone from my life i am all alone there is one exception a distant friend in canada who i chat regularly with there are also childhood friends who make me feel even more alone bad acquantainces i worry about my education friendships my mental health i recently started taking antidepressants but i stopped taking them two weeks ago because i feel strange on them but i am seeing a counselor on monday so i will tell her this then but right now i think i want to die i am so tired of struggling all i have wanted are friends i feel like crying whenever i walk outside and i see groups of people walking together laughing why must it be so difficult a little more than a year ago i thought my social life was finally puzzling itself together but now i think it is hopeless my thought right now is that i want to jump from a building but perhaps the only thing that keeps me from suicide is that the tallest building i can access and second tallest in my city is only 8 floors tall but it hurts so much and i keep thinking that maybe i am lucky and i will go unconscious immediately,1

i am developing strong feelings for my brother in laws best friend what do i do okay so i am helpless somewhat recently i have been developing very serious feelings for my sisters boyfriends best friend i have known this guy for almost three years now through european scouts and ive always found him an amazing person hes very sweet smart and i love spending time with him we have a lot in common so our conversations can be so great not to mention hes the funniest guy i know i kid you not but a while ago i guess i realised exactly how much of an amazing person i find him i cant get him of my mind anymore and its driving me a little crazy first i assumed it was just a little crush that would burn out soon but i think its turning into something a lot more then that now the main issue the agedifference i am 15 and hes 19 i very much realise how this can be a problem were both at a very different stage in our lives and theres a big chance it wouldnt work out well etc i get that and if it was just a small crush i would have let it go and try to move on because i understand the difficulties the agedifference can bring but like i said im positive its more serious then that and ive really tried to let go but not one day has passed without him on my mind i have no idea opbouw he feels about me im afraid he might look at me like a younger sister or his best friends younger sister but i dont think its impossible that he could feel the same way as me definitely not saying im like an expert in bodylanguage or behaviour at all but i tend to always focus a lot on little things people do and what it means im a major overanalyser and overthinker and from what i notice hes definitely not appalled by me when were hanging out so idk another little issue i dont know if this is still the case but he used to havehas feelings for another girl his age but thats been going on for while and she made it quite clear that shes not romantically interested in him tldr i have strong feelings for an older friend 15 and 19 and i know how the age can be an issue but i cant just drop it what should i do should i confront the guy and tell him how i feel or should i wait should i drop it not sure if i just can tho should i tell my brother in law i normally really trust him with stuff like this and he can be a big help but im not sure this time considering its his best friend i really dont know what to do but it feels like i should really do at least something because my mind has been occupied by it 247 and it has been making me very distracted and sad thank u in advance to take the time to help,0

im 24f worried that my friend 24f has schizophrenia andor is in a horrible situation she lives far away with two kids and i dont know what to do my friend and i have been friends since kindergarten we had our ups and downs but for the most part we have always been extremely close i knew she had some issues but as a kid it never really pieced together it was just some small weird conspiracy theories and paranoia nothing that i was really alarmed at i will do my best to summarize here she met a guy when she was 19 and he was 27 red flag for me right off the bat at this time i had moved across the country so note that all updates were from her perspective they would do crack together and i think this fucked a lot with her head eventually he convinced her to have a child and they did things were going okay but she seemed to be raising the kid more or less on her own and working her ass off eventually they had a second kid during their relationship she would bring up how he cheated a couple of times and honestly i just never liked the guy never really got to talk to him but he never gave me good vibes he seemed to want to avoid me but i was her best friend she said he would keep her from staying over at my place because he thought shed cheat on him weird shit like that anyways fast forward 5 years i noticed her and her boyfriend kind of fell off all social media but she was still connected to facebook messenger so i asked if everything was okay the response i got still has me in shock she asked me if anyone asked about her and mentioned she cant trust anyone i told her its fine and she can trust me in saying that i feel bad posting about this here but its pretty anonymous this led her onto a tangent of how she found out that her boyfriend is in a satanic cult he was performing the sick ritual on her this is the only part i can remotely believe i guess it is something to do with grooming someone to be so involved in the relationship they dont notice other things like the person being in a satanic cult she said he gave her an evil eye to follow her that he was fucking his ex so that her kids would be all three of theirs that he was sucking energy from her and her son to bring back his miscarried child from a past relationship she randomly throws in the butterfly drop effect and teslas 3 6 9 theory as if this had anything to do with the conversation i googled them and they dont seem relevant at all this is a symptom of schizo afaik she went to go and get her kids baptized because of this there is more concerning things but i will try to keep this short and i think that gives you a good idea i told her to gather evidence she said they do this in a way so it looks normal but i know the true meaning and he is denying everything so everyone thinks im crazy i feel so lost and helpless right now her kids are 1 and 3 years old and are now on their own with her which means they are either with a mentally unstable parent or they are being sought after by her mentally unstable nowex boyfriend like i said im just lost i dont know how i can help her i dont know if i can i just dont want her or her kids to get hurt tldr i think my childhood best friend either has schizophrenia or similar or her ex is crazy and might hurt her and their two children im across the country and feel helpless how do i handle this,0

rip subways 5 footlongs im super sad over this has anyone else enjoyed these cheap sandwiches as much as me i went to find a subway near me and looked at the online ordering waitblack forest isnt 5meatball isnt 5the damn cold cut combosubways cheapest sub ever is now 675whats going on here so naturally i googd it i found articles like this oneurlspoiler alert theyre gone the ceo says the company will no longer promote the 5 foot long and leaves the option of pricing them at 5 to the individual stores so perhaps your local store has them still theres one store within a 20 mile radius of me that has 1 sub at 5meatball marinara droool shocking my gf and i live very cheaply mostly because im on ssdi were surly broke and have a tiny amount of free cash 11 that wouldve fed us both the delicious subway offerings but noooo says the ceo you guys go buy a package of bologna and some bread and cheese no condiments allowed because you cant afford it says the ceo eat that pig brain and processed cheese sammich thats dry af becauseno condiments hahahahahaaa that isnt a direct quote but basically what hes saying is anyone else upset over this we eat subway once or twice a month and its the only going out food we get to enjoy gone now is that traditionsigh,0

did i 19f ruin it with 24m 3 months ago 19f met 24m john on dating site my ex had cheated so i was openly looking for fwb eventually john asked me to hang out but i told him i was no longer looking for anything he was disappointed but understanding we met up anyway as friends and this is complicated but that night his friend did something to me starts with r automod wont let me say it john was very supportive but a bit wary it happened after he left i didnt really talk to john for a month he continuously asked me to spend time with him he said he wanted to get to know me and he said it would help me face what happened about a month after the r my friends and i were going to a concert and had one extra ticket so i invited john one of my friends with into me and showing it too much even though i had repeatedly enforced my boundaries previously he kept trying to hold my hand walk with me to the bathroom etc apparently john kept asking our 3rd friend if me and this guy were dating later that night john tried to kiss me but i said im not ready to be anything but friends later that week john texted and said he cant stop thinking about me and he has a crush on me which he said he hasnt had in a long time we hung out a few times the next few weeks but he kept asking to have sex and i wouldnt i told him i was scared it would become complicated and he said well probably both get feelings so thats good not complicated he also said it would be hard for him if we didnt have sex so hed have to retrain himself to see me as a friend and didnt know if he could go back he also kept saying he still wants to be friends with me because im really chillsmartetc he constantly compliments my personality he also often asked me if me and the friend from the concert are a thing and if we are hooking up he knew at this point that when we met in person i had just ended a semidatingsex thing with a guy after a few months and that after the r i had been and still was sleeping with a friend to get over it but he knew it was not the friend from the concert eventually we started hanging out more we got drunk and had sex he continued acting the same to me one of his friends got a crush on me and john went out of his way to stop letting me and his friend hang out he even tried to avoid us getting a glimpse of each other in the parking lot then john said one night im starting to like you as more than a friend but im scared of commitment the next time we hung out i said 2 things i said we dont have to hang out every day youre not obligated because we had been hanging out daily and i didnt want him to get bored the thing is i believe this jolted him into trying to start a career im in school and have a good job and he has a degree and a retail job but has trouble getting a career job the second thing is i asked him if he wanted to talk about the relationship thing he said he didnt have much to say and he said im obviously not ready to have a relationship yet with the r and recent abusive relationships that i mentioned in passing and because i had told him before i need to work on myself before i can date he asked if i would want to be friends even if he eventually dated someone else because he said he does like me but he doesnt know about waiting i got sad and said that would be hard anyway after that night he only asked me to hang out maybe twice a week and he went from always answering texts immediately to taking 30 minutes to answer every text however he did initiate a long texting conversation with me the next night now i believe he was acting distant because of my hanging out daily comment and he didnt want to seem like a loser but at the time i got a bit freaked out because i thought i had scared him off with the relationship talk i texted him a few times to ask and i sent too many messages and acted too nervous i came off clingyattachedparanoid he said it was fine the next time we hung out i asked him about it and he first said i was scaring him by saying that us not hanging out as often made me paranoid about us but then he said he understood in the context of the conversationtextingetc then he said maybe we shouldnt sleep together if im going to get attached i said that then my fears were correct and he said that its ok we can keep sleeping together and just take it one day at a time then we hung out again and he acted normal like always even though his textingschedule was still off he doesnt say my name during sex anymore though like he used to he saw that my friend from the concert had texted me a bunch and i didnt want him to be scared off so when i got home i texted him to say that i had a good time and also explained that this is irrelevant to you but he and i arent a thing just clearing that up because he had previously asked about it repeatedly the next morning he woke up and didnt answer my text at all he sent me a meme that he found that morning like probably an hour after waking up but he never addressed the other text i brought it up and he really seemed to want to avoid the conversation i asked him if he saw it and he just said yea i saw it this morning i said i just thought you might want me to clear that up and he eventually said yea thank you for clearing it up now i asked him to hang out again 2 days later but hes on a trip idk for how long he vented to me for like 1 text about how the trip was going badly but then had to go he said hell hit me up when he gets back is this ruined whats going on here did i ruin his feelings for me and did he have any in the first place what can i do to get it back to how it was tldr guy was super into me even after sex he brought up feelings i freaked out and acted clingyparanoid for a week he seems distant but not gone whats going on and is it reversible,0

a tragic story tonight is when it happened in fact it was only moments ago it all started when i was chilling in my room watching netflix thats when i saw it a motherfucking fly snuck into my room i knew what i had to do so i a armed myself with the best weapon in my room the notebook i use for my physics class i turned off all the fans in my room so no air current would frighten it i then proceeded to patiently wait in the middle of my room waiting for it to stop flying around and settle down on one of the surfaces that composes my room for many minutes i awaited the moment but thy moment in fact did not came since i was no amateur i knew what i had to do next i adjusted my strategy instead of obliterating it i decided to let it live but and only but if it left my room peacefully i then opened my door wide open killed the lights illuminated the restroom and left to get a quick snack after grabbing a half empty bag of doritos i came back to the few squares meters that i use as my own living space i lifted the tiny lever on the wall and thus there was light thats when i saw it the fucking fly my ultimate most noble of all opponent i guess that the darkness i created gave it a false feeling of security during my departure i swiftly grabbed my notebook took my time to aim because i knew it was my only chance quickly chanted in my mind if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment would you capture it or just let it slip his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready a mighty ballad to give me courage and strength in this trying time afraid of missing my shot i then struck with all the force that the gods handed me it didnt fly away my target had been eliminated i lifted the killer pile of paper and thats when i saw it it fucking exploded it was absolutely everywhere on the previously clean and white wall i grabbed a kleenex and began the cleaning deed unfortunately that action only spread the damn bug and created an even bigger area of insect flesh and organs i cleaned betterly and that was it now if yall dont mind well move on to the funeral service first of all i would like to say some words ill begin that thanking you all for coming i know it would mean a lot to it if it was here today i didnt get to know it very well but i definitely met it at its prime when i first saw it it was fluttering gracefully i dont know if it was out of joy or out of fear but it sure as hell was beautiful in fact for the majority of the time i knew it it was flying i only saw it land once and unfortunately it died quickly succeeding this moment of peace for it at least we will know that it was a good death for it on top of that lets never forget that bits of it will alway be with us on my physics notebook once again thanks for coming thanks for listening to me and id like to finish this ceremony by playing its favorite songurl,0

19m not much experience with women but i like a 18f more info in actual post so starting off for some context i am possibly one of the most worst people with this kind of stuff my dumbass literally never had a significant otherpartner because i didnt care about that shit till about 1617 years old i have a chronic stammer similar to a stutter but instead of repeating the same word i just cant say the word and just repeat the syllable till i can actually say it this will be important later i am also live on my college campus so on with the post this girl i like i met through my group of friends shes always been friendly and quiet seems like a nice person in general she had this flier for her friends party on her social media page i also never go to parties never got drunk high etc i didnt think of it much at first but i saw her walk by on campus and she said hi to me then asked if i was coming to the party i told her im not sure because i might go home for the weekend i wasnt too into her at this point but i was still into her if you get what i mean i thought about it and after a while i was like fuck it just go i went to my nearby target and bought a polo for the night that same night i added a post on my one page dropping my username on my other social media and she was one of the few people who added me that night i was like oh cool probably doesnt mean shit dont get too hyped about it buddy we talked a little before the party just random talk etc but onto the party i go to the roommate with my party we get there early and get drinks not enough to get smashed but later the girl i like comes to the party and after a little while i ask her if she can get us some drinks because we hadnt had any in a while well heres where it gets interesting i get smashed for the first time and im like oh shit this is fuckin awesome im the opposite of myself i can actually speak without fumbling on my words my confidence is shooting through the roof im talking to random people another thing i dont do i slightly stumble while walking etc we eventually go back to the dorms we live at not getting caught relax for like 30 mins see the girl texts me wya or something like that i say at the dorms and tell her my room number and surprisingly she comes in like 510 minutes or something we get to our room and were just talking nothing stupid we get to the topic about her and her past bfs she said she had 2 and she just got out of one recently within a month or so but she still has her card if you know what im talking about and throughout this whole conversation my confident ass is making compliments like you looked really good tonight etc and other stuff like that just being a stupid drunk dickhead not sure if she was smashed or whatever didnt seem like it but she saw i clearly was she goes on and says she doesnt like guys who get with chicks just to smash and mentioned my roommate does shit like that then as shes leaving i give her a hug and tell her thanks for tonight and i jokingly say holy fuck im cringing typing this can i get a kiss and she just laughs and brushes it off and politely says no i texted her later for her number on social media i went to bed and she gave me her number in the morning and she said i take a while to text because im busy a lot or something along the lines of that she does work a lot though so thats whats giving me hope i texted her in the morning saying im so sorry for being a drunk dumbass last night it was my first time and she said its ok its a new day today something like that we talk and stuff etc which leads me to where im at now i didnt think of it in the morning but i think she said she takes a while to text back just to curve me im super shitty with this stuff so of course the good side of me is saying have some hope you dumb fuck while the other side is saying you done fucked it up opinions tldr i got invited to party to one of my female friends party got smashed for the first time went back to my dorm she also came back to my dorm room and we talked i said some questionable things and compliments and came off strongly while under the influence she gave me her number but said her text back game is weak but still talks to me part of me thinks she curved me and another part ones to just have hope i still feel stupid for coming off strong because i literally have no confidence when im not drunk and wouldnt say those things if i was drunk,0

dear daddear dad i guess me calling you dad would shock you i always called you by name because mum forced it on me i remember you admitting youd punched her in the face i remember you admitting to your criminal record i remember that honesty was something you valued highly and even though i dont condone domestic abuse or violence i know how twisted and cruel mum can be i understand i dont remember you that well after what happened i blocked you out i was obsessed with being strong and cold i never spoke of you well i never initiated it to anyone for years but i do remember us going out to the zoo to the swimming baths to the cinema to blackpool caravans i remember that i was too damaged and mentally ill to form a relationship with you i desired the closeness but because of my mothers interference and how she poisoned me against you i guess i was too young to even understand what i was doing but i miss sharing a bed i still remember being 5 years old and us arguing about who would sleep on the couch i felt bad and refused to let you sleep on the couch whilst i got the bed eventually we were both too stubborn to do anything so we shared the bed that was our tradition until the end id wake up to see you looking at me you had the most beautiful blue green eyes sometimes youd hold my hand as i slept it happened quite often wed lay awake each night in the dark holding hands lying on our backs and wed just talk near the end you seemed to be getting depressed sleeping a lot but i still would sometimes wake up with my hand sweaty from yours and your face inches from mine even when i would wake up to see your eyes shut you quite often would wake up a moment later and stare into my eyes i havent ever seen so much love in someones eyes that way before i never saw anybody look at me the way you did i doubt anybody would love me anywhere near as much as you did i will never forget it it breaks my heart every time i recognise that expression in other fathers of young girls i remember at 12yrs old when i got my first bra and period you talked about no longer sharing a bed i vehemently refused to sleep apart and so we continued our tradition i know bits about you now how you desired to be loved how much you fought at court to see me how much you loved me and wanted me to love you the way other kids love their parents thats why you got engaged to that cunt who hated me at 18 you met a woman you loved with a young boy you were a kind thoughtful man well known for being generous and would do anything for a stranger i saw numerous times you doing selfless things for strangers you were incredibly kind you did a year or so in prison for breaking into a supermarket one night and stealing you gave the money to a friend hoping hed give her the money he didnt when you came out of prison you continued to support her and your son you only broke up i believe because she cheated on you as a teenager you stayed with a woman went to prison and helped raise a boy who wasnt yours i wont pretend you were a saint because you werent but you certainly wasnt bad anyways you had just turned 42 earlier that month and i was 12 it was 2010 and you were in your long term girlfriends house it was around 1am and you apparently heard a noise in the back garden you were brave and loyal and caring careless and impulsive you did what many people would do for somebody they loved or thought they loved you tried to protect them you opened the door that was when you were murdered september 2010 you were hit in the head with some pipe then stabbed in the heart that was you over gone your fiance went into your flat later that day if i remember correctly she took your mattress and your washing machine she also took pictures you wanted me to have other sentimental things that were of no value to spite my family i was a mentally ill 12 year old in a special needs school who cut themselves and had attempted suicide 10 months earlier i came home to see my paternal grandmother with my maternal grandfather mum was crying my grandmother explained what happened i got into my mothers lap and cried after a few were arrested we pushed for the police to do more i found out you sold cannabis though only to people you knew well after we complained again the police threatened to release the information about your criminal activity to the public when a parent is murdered the child receives money when they get older if that parent has a criminal record then you arent entitled to it i wasnt it took weeks for the funeral to take place because of the evidence i became extremely close to one of your brothers the case was shut soon after nobody was ever caught its still unsolved and will always be unsolved im sorry dad i wish there was justice for you but there never will be im so so sorry life got harder dad my boyfriend sexually assaulted me at 13 i held a man whilst he died of a heart attack i continued to cut myself i overdosed again at 13 at 15 my mother threw me out and your brother took me in and raised me were so close these days he is like a father to me hes not able to show love like you were but now i can express love i wish i had been able to do this whilst you were alive it kills me to think you didnt feel loved by me before you died the guilt and self hatred and loneliness is so bad that it took years for me to face it i admit i started abusing drugs at 15 im a drug addict now at 20 i have more than 300 scars over my body my legs arm shoulder and chest i also got piercings i have 10 currently if you knew where some of them are youd cringe i dont think you would of liked the woman ive become but i think youd understand why im such a mess i miss you so much i lost the only happy optimistic person ever my life has a permanent dullness that i need to escape from anyway necessary i know if you had been alive you wouldnt of let my mum put me into a care home you made the right choice asking your brother to take me in hes treated me so well im 20 now i have a boyfriend of 4 months im unemployed and on benefits but i know thats not forever im getting my own place soon i plan to make a little place in my flat dedicated to you i love you with all my heart i know you loved me too your murder broke me and changed me completely ill forever be devastated but im getting better one day i hope i can be the kind of woman youd be proud to call your daughter ill be bringing my boyfriend around to your grave again around your birthday nobody should celebrate their 50th alone love from e,1

almost burning my house down so me and a few mates were outside by the pool having a bit of a drink it started to get bit chilly so we decided to get a bonfire going problem was we had fire wood but no fire starters we thought we pulled it off by lighting a piece of cardboard but the flame was going out and at this point we were freezing our asses off we were getting frustrated so my friends decide that its a great idea to pour some petrol in fuck yeah it workedfor a second then it died again so we poured a little more in this is where it all went to shit out of no where the can was engulfed in flames at this point everyones yelling at me to throw it into the pool before it blows up but no that didnt happen why because i couldnt bare to clean the pool afterwards laziness my life good prioritising ey so instead i instinctively slowly place the flaming canister on the ground surprisingly i was pretty calm about the impending explosion i casually walked and got a bucket of water thinking it would easily fix the problem i was wrong instead the water somehow managed to spread the fire across the tiled ground right next to the gas bottle by the bbq cant get any worse huh at this point you have my sister looking out the window with a phone in her hand calling the fire brigade luckily a mate took the initiative and kicked the can into the pool hes shoe on fire but he saved the house from burning down safe to say thats last time im using petrol tldr im an idiot and dont mess with fire,0

im giving up trigger warning hi before i start talking about everything i want you to know that im not an open person at all everything happens to me i keep it inside of me i dont share at all because i believe that im a strong person and i dont need anyone and no one can help me and me posting and writing about me right now means i have reached my maximum desperation level suicide is easier for me than talking about whats on my mind but here i am talking i have attempted suicide on 1st april 2018 i hanged myself with the belt and i passed away for few minutes the house was empty my brother got home and he managed to save me before doing this attempt i was thinking all the time in every way that i could have a reason that im not seeing to be alive even after attempting suicide i still think that i should do it again to be honest my mom gonna travel in april again and the house gonna be empty and im preparing myself for committing suicide again and for the last time the reason is i have nothing no life no help no reason no job no college i can go to really nothing and if you wanna know why and how its simple its because i live in iraq i been living in iraq since the day i was born and that is my curse i been trying to leave since the moment i started walking iraq passport is before the last worst passport in the world baghdad the capital is the worst city in the world to live in since 2016 i guess theres no chance for me here i tried and believe me when i say it i tried everything to leave to run away to work to find new ways but theres always a close road for me i cant find another place to live in i have no life here no father he left us since i was 9 years old when i was 9 i was scared and sad because that happened so i started to listen to english music basically eminem and i fell in love with him even tho i dont know what he was saying so i promised myself to learn the language and understand every song he makes thats how i speak english now also it is my curse to be honest because english made me what i am now open minded guy who thinks and knows many things who knows how stupid and ignorant his community is who knows how everyone around is so dumb and not humans at all because no one here talk about emotions no one care no one thinks about the other i learned a lot because of my english language and i believed when i was a kid me knowing the language and getting better at it will be my ticket out of here so i kept focusing on it for years every day every hour in every song till the moment came and i found out that its not even my ticket and i cant leave because i only speak english i cant stand spending another year in this place at all i cant be myself i cant even do my hobbies and find what im really good at because theres no right places for such things here im giving up and i dont know its the end of the line for me here i thought about sharing because i thought maybe nothing is changing because i keep everything inside of me so here i am lost and dont know how to live like a human and at a least have a home,1

im trying to apply for universities and im honestly so overwhelmed i love music with all my heart its hard to explain it to virtual strangers but the amount of love i hold for music is honestly unparalleled in my life my goal in life was always to work in a musicrelated field but my parents kind of gently pressured me into a more realistic field they didnt outright force me but id feel guilty if i didnt do what they said im currently applying to study law with the goal of eventually studying criminal law and criminology as a masters we dont do the bar here we practice civil law here as opposed to common law i intend to do musicrelated work on the side working in record stores volunteering at festivals trying to find places to write for etc in hopes someone notices and using law as my safety net when i told my friend this he told me that it was really sad that i was pursuing something im not awfully keen on law just because i dont feel my passion is realisticsupported by my family i guess i just feel bad if i took a musical road id probably end up broke and wouldnt get far and id disappoint my parents but if i followed law i wouldnt be as happy because my heart isnt fully there i guess im just lost edit its really late here nearing midnight and as much as i know i gotta reply to comments in the next 3 hours i really cant afford to stay awake till 3 as i get up at 6 if anyone comments though i promise ill reply first thing in the morning hoping the mods are cool with that,0

any suggestions i think we all know how depression works does anyone know how to fix this so i have friends sure but barely any i trust and so very little i actually like to hang out with because i dont see them as being real and most are self absorbed and yet by my not being their friends me eating alone and sticking my nose in a book completely alone and ostracizing my self is almost like a barrier from this world so i dont have to face the real world deep down i hate it and ive fallen low before because of this lonely feeling i dont want that to happen not again is there a certain perspective i could keep in mind i could make friends but i dont want to because i know none of them will count so many people have left me you see i dont want to be alone so i stick my nose in a book but i also see the truth in how many people in my age group have trouble creating an actual trust worthy friendship and i dont need any of that been there done that and yet i feel alone even though i know im making the right choice in separating myself from false hope hopefully the doubt and unwavering pain from my last break doesnt crumble all my walls god forbid i dont become how i used to be,1

how to handle anything at allhelp parents understand what depression is so ive been in bed for about 6 days now have just kindve completely checked out at this point when i get like this my parents try flipping between compassion and weird motivational speak but the condescension and animosity they line their phrases with is kindve mindblowing to be honest i made the mistake of buying into that bullshit spiel about reaching out and telling someone because my life is so fucking sacred by asking my mom if i could see someone asap i get that she and my father are frustrated ive been through over a half dozen therapists and tried at least a dozen different medications at this point and im a pretty fucking pathetic kid for someone to produce but her response just really sucked she said there was no use trying any medication or therapy at this point because up till now it hasnt worked so here on out its up to me whether i live life or not i dont think theyre privy to my constant suicidal ideations but this was really just about the dumbest thing ive heard yet at least they used to lace their bullshit motivational phrases with less repugnancy some therapistsmeds just arent a good fit gotta keep trying the notion that i just cherish not having the motivation to shower or leave my bed is frankly the most backwards thing ive heard from them and really goes to show how little regard they seem to have for mental illness as a whole i would fucking looooooooove to just plaster on a big fucking smile and actually mean it for once get up in the morning every morning and just manage to do something billions of other people seem to flawlessly manage i would absolutely love this they flat out said they didnt think i liked to work which is why i was avoiding school christ so basically there is no more reaching out because theyre tired of dealing with me believe me i get it im just grateful no one can say i didnt try considering they dont seem to be interested in continuing to pursue psychotherapy because yknow weve totally done literally everything medicine has to offer and at this point i just gotta get my game face on i get that theyre fucking tuckered out i sure as hell am but i feel like this at the very least prevents them from license to grieve because i really do not know what else to do at this point i would love to be just dandy i would but how the fuck sorry if youve read this far i assure you that it was a massive waste of your time,1
i f15 kind of messed up my friendship with my friend m15 because of my feelings for him any advice on anything well first off ill say ive had feelings for him since about say august 2017 sometime then yeah its been long i guess anyway a lot of shit has gone down since then non of which included us getting together we become pretty good friends over the years so im a sophomore this year and i have exams pretty fucking soon all im trying to do is just get over him so i can try to focus because at this age it is pretty obvious that a male species would have my full attention let me just tell you i cannot concentrate on my life because of this dumb boy so i asked a few people for advice and i was finally convinced to tell him with my stupid ass i decided to text him yes i texted him a long ass paragraph explaining my whole life story to him i switched off my wifi immediately because i was scared off all the possibilities i couldnt sleep that night so i got up at about 12 am just to see what he said keep in mine that i was awake all that time thinking up all sorts of replies he would have made well there is one option that never crossed my mind that he would reply guess what happened he didnt reply that was a whole day ago today being friday and just an athletics day at school he didnt even bother showing up to school as we wouldnt have any classes so im sitting here at 11 in the night thinking of what he might be thinking too im not ok fr i dont know what to do this post might just get hidden and buried under so many but if youve reached up to here and have anything to say please do im open for any sort of criticism tldr i admitted to liking this boy and he hasnt replied to me ever since then help,0

tell me 38f why i should not blow him 39 up to his girl like an army grenade i always read this in other posts so ill also ask you to forgive the cell phone formatting tldr at the bottom i was seeing a man for four months who was separated legally but still married in this time he treated me great we went out we had deep talks we did kind gestures for each other then after i made a large gesture he told me he just wanted to be friends he couldnt give me the relationship i wanted because he was just not ready he previously told me he saw a future with me so i asked if that was still the case and he said no this was january 15 it hurt but i understood we didnt see each again until a random runin in early feb we chatted briefly he mentioned how great i looked and how nice it was to see me that was the last contact until this past saturday saturday night i went out and when i returned home via uber i realized i had lost my keys i couldnt get in my building so i called him at 130 am and asked him to let me in he did and we went to his apartment where i made calls to track down my keys he was really sweet and tried to make me feel better about being an irresponsible twat for leaving my keys in the first uber i took that night i was quite intoxicated and i only remember bits and pieces of the night but i recall him telling me to come close and lay my head on his shoulder he held me and caressed me just like he used to we fell asleep together waiting for the uber driver to call back but he didnt until 9 the next morning i eventually laid down in his bed and when i woke up a few hours later he was sleeping on the couch so nothing happened all night and morning he continuously made comments about my body in this really sexy dress i was wearing told me how great i smelled and that he was drooling over me i shrugged off the comments but laughed and smiled and felt flattered he drove me one hour to pick up the keys we had a great time laughing and joking on the ride down and back i thanked him dozens of times and offered to treat him to dinner i kissed him on the cheek and went home the next day i thanked him again via text and asked him when he wanted to go to the thank you dinner he said he didnt need to be rewarded because looking at me in my dress was reward enough cute then i asked him if we could be friends heres where shit got real he became really short and dry with me taking an hour sometimes to respond i took this to mean that he didnt want to be friends and offered to just go back to being cordial when we see each other we live in the same apartment building he said we can be friends the way you have described as long as no feelings are involved clearly i still love the guy but the tone was just so dry and callous that frankly it made me reconsider the friendship idea but i jokingly asked whose feelings are you concerned about because after the other night u cant possibly act like you dont have feelings for me he proceeded to tell me that he didnt never did that i was just a fuck and that he played me and used me he said he just wanted attention and sex from a pretty woman and thats all it was i was inhouse pussy he said he sprinkled in a few lols just to be sure i knew how much of a joke i was to him this was via text this morning i started my day absolutely gutted ive been crying all morning and i cant stop the vindictive part of me wants to send all the adulterous texts to his wife he told me she is requesting alimony and proof of infidelity might get it for her they were married in a state in which regardless of legal separation the parties are still legally married and any sexual contact during the separation is adultery i can prove the contact and fuck him up financially by sharing this with his wife he hurt me and he did so maliciously i have the power to do the same should i go there reddit im so hurt and angry inside that someone could do this to person who only showed kindness and love hurting him is the only thought that gives me any solace right now what should i do and why tldr legally separated man used me and tossed me aside with malice i have the means to get revenge by telling his wife about our relationship almost ensuring that he will be forced to pay her alimony should i hurt him back or let it go,0

reasons to not join the 27 clubits my 27th birthday tomorrow and a few people have joked to me about not joining the 27 club if only they knew that i have contemplated being part of it in my low moments and so i figured id write a list of my reasons not to join it in hopes of helping myself and others who struggle your pain and trauma is not who you are even in the most difficult of circumstances things can improve the love that you have in your heart will be awakened again your reason to go on should not be dictated by the amount of texts you received today progress takes time some of the best and the greatest humans in history accomplished things over the course of decades whatever mark you want to leave on this world can happen you are loved and cherished by your friends and family even the ones that dont have the emotional capacity to tell you you have the power to make a positive influence on someone or something your ideas and art should see the light of day even if your luck seems down or that everything is wrong focus on your body your health if you have food in the fridge internet clothes an education etc you are far better off than most people in the world try to take that negative energy and focus it towards being grateful towards your passions and towards your breath go take a walk write down a crazy story about you achieving your greatest dream of all time and how you felt side note as i was writing the last line of that there was a knock on my bedroom door i opened it up to find two of my best friends they stood there with a box of brownies and came to surprise me we proceeded by sitting on my balcony with some tea and they brought in my 27th birthday for me i almost cried and that my friends is literally the essence of what we live for to reap every second we have to enjoy the company of other souls and make every second count sending all my love and virtual brownies to whoever needs it,1

im a girl and i just killed a hugeass millipede and im pretty proud of myself uhh you know how theres that stereotype that girls are afraid of insects and scream like crazy when they see them well its real those are my two sisters meanwhile im just different im scared of insects too but i hate their unwelcome presence more so i have to kill them i was lazing around in bed when the hugeass millipede appeared in the living room since im the only one who dares to kill insects my younger sister knocked on my door frantically asking me to save them lol i sighed put down my phone grabbed my meat free monday cookbook which i had yet to unwrap ha and went out to kill the millipede my elder sisters screams got super high pitched fucking annoying and she was crying ugh overreacting like usual my younger sister yelled when i threw the book down onto the millipede rip millipede right now im back in the safety and comfort of my own bed i left my book on the ground because i dont want to dispose the dead millipede its really disgusting its times like this i wish i had a dedicated boyfriend to clean this up haha 2019 will be the year i find a boyfriend oh and it felt like a great ego boost to be needed and the person who actually did something instead of screaming and crying helplessly i feel like such a badass what a great way to end the night although it wouldve been so much better without the annoying high pitched screams thank you very much thanks for reading and have a nice day,0

i sucked my own penis it has been 4 hours since i successfully sucked my own penis things are different now as soon as mouthto penis contact was made i felt a shockwave through my body i have reason to believe i have super strength and telekinesis now 3 hours after contact i noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival i fear for my safety im not sure what sort of power i may have stumbled upon but its possible that the government has found out if i dont update this again please send help update just escaped from the pentagon the government is sending all their military forces to pursue me my life is currently in extreme peril they attempted to strip my ability to suck my own penis but i created a shockwave to blast away the researchers before they could touch me this is bad i have exhausted all my chromosomes and now i have to hide and replenish my energy while the patrol helicopters fly over me,0
eating honey mustard sauce with my hamburger this actually is just happening im at my girlfriends house shes got the flu and has fever and all i ate a hamburger from a place close to home and might have added too much honey mustard anyway as a result i have the most horribly painful diarrhea i have had in the last 6 months i cannot explain with enough words how my anus feels right now so i took a gloriously smelly and painful dump before going out with her parents to go see the apartment theyll move to next week theyre actually very happy about it and i am too its a beautiful and big apartment and the rent is very nice anyway coming back from the apartment my girlfriend wanted to buy food and then decided against it because i had such a huge urge to give birth to a bottle of shitfilled anal water and then she said i have fever to her mother and well we went to the drugstore to get her something and it was such an embarrasing experience because my face was just changing shapes while waiting for her to pay for the meds and here i am shitting on her toilet what a gloriously painful shit will update update1 shes literally reading tifu from my account on the computer now and theres no soap update2 my anus feels like its being barbecued with a flamethrower update3 apparently what i washed my hands with was female intimate shower gel update4 the smell is still there this is so embarrasing,0
weightlifting why do people do it not sure if this belongs here sorry if it doesnt tried it on rfitness but it was removed why do people take on the hobby of weight lifting i started weightlifting a few days ago and i just realized how im gonna get hate but here it goes unhealthily in a way it is every weightlifting supplement out there is full of artificial sweeteners theres bulking up which people often get carbs from everywhere possible fast food then cutting etc ive always wanted to have this hobby but now im not even sure anymore if it means not being healthy back when i was in 78th i was really obese then i started losing it by sophomore and started doing trackcross country and i started doing all of this because my family has a strong diabetes history which i wanted to avoid which is why i completely took all sugar out of my diet and all the unhealthy food out along with it weightlifters of rfitness why do you have this hobby,0
my best friend hanged herself 2 years ago and i only came to know about it yesterday i had just moved from australia to india because i was very mentally unstable the minute i moved to india i was admitted to the psych ward because i could never be left alone for even one second because i was so bent upon harming and killing myself i hated myself and i was so depressed i had crazy hallucinations and delusions that everyone was plotting a murder to murder me in a gruesome way so i just wanted to kill myself before anyone else could when i was admitted in the ward there i met her she was draped in purple from head to toe she came with her mother who always seemed to be smiling we introduced ourselves very quickly because we were of the same age very soon we developed a very very close bond we were there with each continously day and night until the nurse had to physically drag her out of my room we connected so well from the start because we suffered from very similar issues both of us had depression and ocd i could freely talk to her about suicide in a way that i could with no one else and she would know exactly what to say because she had been through the pain both of used to obsess about the idea of death and we had very similar thought processes which always made us question about why we hadnt met each other earlier however we were both very happy to have met atleast then and honestly i felt like i had known her for years she was so talented she was a very active blogger she used to write dark stories about death and would drop a new blog every week she had so much potential and she was original she was obsessed with the color purple she wouldnt dare to wear any other color which wasnt atleast a shade of purple she was a very outgoing gal and even though she understood suicide deeply she was still very optimistic and would love making friends in the ward however she wasnt diagnosed and i had never realized this but she would copy or do or say some of the same things that i or the other patients would do and tbh i didnt rly think much of it the doctors knowing this asked her if she was faking it because she was friends with me they were asking her why she was doing and saying the same things as me i remember her being very upset by this and tbh i dont think she was copying or saying the same things as me but whatever so after 5 months of torture obviously but a lot less torture because of her she honestly made my life heaven idk what i would have done there without her so they discharged me when they discharged me we were both rly sad coz she was gonna be there and i was going home she showered me with gifts such a necklaces books purple tea etc it was a sad goodbye however i was happy that i was getting out after 2 days of reality i couldnt do it anymore i became suicidal as usual and little did ik that in my room there was an open window i lived in the 5th floor of an apartment and i remember climbing out of the window and sitting there i was so ready to jump because i knew i was never gonna get another perfect chance like this i tried not to over think too much because i really wanted to kill myself and i wanted nothing to interrupt menot even a thought the height was also huge so i knew i would die in a painful way while jumping i tried aiming for my head however when i jumped i landed on my foot i felt a shock so painful travel through my body it was chaos everyone was freaking out i slowly felt myself passing out everyone was terrorized anyway i was put in an ambulance i dont wanna talk too much about this but i broke every single bone in my body but my foot spinal cord one of my ribs tail bone broke in a very very serious way so i obviously went through days and days of complicated surgery and pain they were sure that i wouldnt walk so after a while i was moved to the psych ward again i again met her and i was in so much pain i couldnt even cry or smile and she was just a little mad that i would do this but she was so happy to see me again she helped me through all of it she was there like my mom she was even there to help me move my fucking body when i was in so much pain just to take a shit in the bed pan everytime she used to read books to me she made playlists for me to listen to she always always always made sure that i was occupied and made sure to distract me from the physical pain i remember as i was recovering she was the one who would push my wheel chair to take a walk and we would gossip talk about boys celebs talk about dumb meaningless shit etc and to everyones surprise after 6 months i was able to walk 2 steps with a walker though painful i was atleast able to stand so everyone was happy about the progress after a while i was able to walk a little with the walker and they discharged me so i could go home in this mean time my friend and her mom left the hospital as they felt like she hadnt made any progress and she was angry with the doctors questioning about her faking it so they decided to move to another state and we promised to keep contact we kept in touch for a while and had a lot of fun as per usual her mom also kept updating my mom after a while everything suddenly stopped i stopped recieving anything from her and at this time i was going through other personal and painful shit so i had relapsed badly again and i had forgotten about everything after a year i tried reaching out to her in every way possible i kept texting her like a fool till last week i thought she had just abandoned social media or i thought that started to dislike me i wasnt sure what to think of it and my mom kept pressuring me to forget about her so for a while i just let it slide even tho i was upset and confused anyway yesterday midnight i got a message from some random guy who knew both of us saying that she hanged herself this guy refused to tell me his name and he told me that she died a long back but nobody told u coz u were already suicidal and we didnt want it affect u so just to make sure i reached out to one of her neighbors as well as a close friend to make sure if she actually killed herself turns out she hanged herself 2 years ago i was in a state of shock and i still am im not angry that she chose to take her life im happy that she is in a much better place coz this world is not meant for everyone i was upset and im still upset because i didnt know sooner im upset that i have only come to know now because i had been trying to reach out to her like every 2 days like an idiot for a like 2 years im upset that i couldnt help her in the same way she helped me i wish i could have told her how much she meant to me and how much she changed my life before she left this awful place she had so much potential i wish i died instead of her i dont have any purpose on this planet and neither do i have any talent i just waste oxygen and take up fuckimg space she could have offered so much and she already had so much to offer to this world im jealous of how lucky she was to die in her first attempt its hard to die when ur killing yourself but im also happy for her at the same time i just wish i could meet her soon some day and tell her how much she helped me and how much she meant to me i didnt expect this i am heart broken not because she left but because i didnt die and meet her there soon enough i feel numb i dont know what to do or say im upset that i came to know about it so late i just wish that u are happy wherever u are and i love u so fucking much rest in peace b,1

tfw you expose a creep tldr i called out a roblox youtuber with 300k subscribers months ago and the document is finally getting popular hes getting a lot of negative attention and is deleting comments from his channel regarding the situation as well as constantly running away from making a response despite the fact hes been called out for this since 2016 most people know i wrote the document and i cant handle the attention if im honest but im glad its getting bigger,0
is he m27 still interested in me f23 super lengthy post so click off if you dont want to read it rather than complaining about how long it is in the comments but i really need advice and opinions badly please read the whole thing i met a man several months ago on a dating app he was kind and sweet we spoke for a month before we met up i was really busy with exams and work i wasnt expecting him to wait that long but he did we texted and snapchatted a ton but didnt speak on the phone cuz he didnt like phone callswhich was fine both of us were looking for something casual and a no strings attached situation after coming out of serious relationships i told him i didnt want to drop my pants for someone the first time i meet them so i wont be having sex the first time he was completely fine with that when we finally met up we had such a great time we got along great and made out tons he didnt want the date to end so i did go back to his place but we just rolled around in bed basically dry humping and making out hes a guy thats slept with a lot of women i could tell he knows how to please a woman too again we both wanted a very casual nsa thing before we met but spoke a lot he told me he was falling for me ummm that hed be my date to a fam wedding of mine that i should go to his cottage over the summer with him and his friends etc also during the date when i went to his house i met his friends and he gave me a tour of his whole house he was proud of building he was talking about his godson and how one day ill meet him too after the date we still spoke but not to the extent we use to wed still talk every day though hed mostly initiate it i was busy again whenever he wanted to meet up and this time he wanted to meet for sex and hanging out which was understandable i know i was being shitty here by being too busy but i did have a lot going on and it was a very tough time in my life plus i felt fuck buddies didnt need to meet all the time about 2 weeks after our first date i asked if he was down for drink that following friday or thursday night he said he was busy with school i knew that was a lie cuz he only has school monwed but hed let me know he replied to my text to hang out 4 days after i sent it and he was active on social media during that time i replied saying if youre not interested anymore thats totally fine and to let me know rather than leave me hanging i also wished him well with school i didnt want to end in a negative way cuz i hate that anyways he never replied to that text so i was like okay on to the next then he did keep watching my snapchat stories though a month later he contacted me by sending me a shirtless mirror selfie i couldnt help but laugh and was caught off guard i was seeing someone else at the time casually but immaturely and rudely wanted to keep him on the hook like he basically kept me on the hook hes very attractive and i can tell hed be a good lay for a good 10ish days we were back to snapping every day but i was a lot colder i kept saying i was busy and that id let him know when im free and then he said okay let me know i said will do and he stopped contacting again he also stopped watching my snap stories which was unusual behaviour from him 34 months later i created an instagram somehow he was one on the first 30 people to follow me i guess i came up in is suggested contacts or something he likes almost all my pictures and watches my instagram stories i know hes seeing women and doing this with them too since its clearly evident wtf is up with this dude i posted a picture to my instagram story of a baked item i made and he replied to my story with the fire emoticon i said wow long time thank u and he replied i know been busy i said same and he never replied then a couple days later i posted a lot of pictures and videos on my story from a drunk girls night out the last picture was my best friend and i asking if anyone wants to go on a road trip with us let us know we cute and we dont bite too much serious inquires only he replied and said lets do it we talked for a little bit and he suggested a place to go but the conversation quickly fizzled lastly he asked a while back when he can see me again and called me babe i said not right now cuz im in a sticky situation but soon im down for a fuck tbh he said no worries and he hopes everything is ok then said let me know when you want to go on an adventure with me i said what kind of adventure and he said outdoors beach cottage camping etc he is talking a lot more dry then he usually does and takes at least 10 hours to respond to a text but this is an interesting fuck budhe said his friend has a cottage if im down to go anyways that convo fizzled out too he posted a cute picture of his dog to his story to which i replied omg hes adorable he said feel free to come visit he doesnt bite and i said will do when i have time we have to go on that adventure later in july btw he never replied to that a day later he asked me if i wanted to go to the beach that weekend with him i said i was working till late but im going to my friends cottage later that weekend and will see if he can come too if its a huge party he was down but my friend declined extra people so i told him he wasnt allowed and i was sorry also to tease a bit but i was full on serious as well i was like aaahhh damn i was hoping this could work out cuz one of my friends and i are both bi and we all would have had a lit time another time for sure he said no worries have fun we will have fun in the sun when you come back you can bring your friend too if you want to which i said shes more gay than straight but ill see if shes down lmao sorry for assuming things im assuming you contacted me again for something casual if not thats totally fine too just trying to figure out where your mind is at now this is what i dont understand his reply to that help me figure it out please its cool not sure what im looking for kinda want to see what happens have a great weekend cutie whatever that is suppose to mean anyways later on hed casually respond to some of my snapchat stories with saying sexy and even asked whose house is that when i was at a friends 78 million dollar lake house about a week later i asked so are we ever going on that adventure or to which he responded sorry been busy im going to _______ the last weekend of august if youre interested i said sure im down if work permits it i dont want to intrude on your plans ill probably bring a friend or two how many of you are going but i really want to do something next weekend work is consuming my life he said lol thats fine not sure my friend is planning it if your free lets hit a trail or grab a drink im free join the club all i do is work then i was like im down free sometime next week for drinks what does your work schedule look like he didnt open the message for two days its on instagram but hes been active and then he opened it but never replied a week after he ghosted he wasnt watching my stories either then the weekend we were suppose to chill he started watching everything religiously again from that point on about a month later he replied to my story asking me where i worked saying damn to attractive selfies but not progressing more for a couple months he also realized i was having a party and asked when it was i

using a glory hole for balance reposting as my prior one apparently wasnt considered me fucking up so they removed it few weekends ago my boyfriend and i decide to go to a local bathhouse to fool around and maybe fool around with someone else was our first time we were fairly nervous after touring the inside we would occasionally stop and fool around with one another before continuing to explore the building at some point we wind up in a stall which is roughly the size of a bathroom stall sans bathroom on either side of the walls are long rectangular holes around mid thigh high boyfriend and i are entwined with one another going at it and for balance i absentmindedly stick my foot into one of the holes propping myself up yeah my mistake at some point someone starts sucking on my toes from the other side i know it was that due to them occasionally softly nibbling them as well at first it was a little offputting but i was getting closer to orgasm with my boyfriend so i went with it suddenly the mouth stops a moment of nothing and then warmth i feel some slight hair and then the top half of my foot is engulfed several thrusts go by before i finally realize that my the literal top of half of my foot is in someones ass i literally had my foot inside another persons ass the entire top half of my foot within seconds i promptly withdrew my foot struggling to see if my assaulted foot now resembled a fudge brownie and burst into emotional breakdown hysterical laughter of disbelief then rushed to the showers tldr went to a bathhouse and my foot ended up in someones ass,0

overcame my anxiety about driving today positive moment i turned 24 recently and up until a year ago i hadnt had a license never wanted one due to worries about being on the road even after getting a license and buying a car i just couldnt bring myself to ride around so my mother continued taking me to work but my mother is in the hospital and i was so close to calling in sick today my sister reminded me about all the insecurities within me about people looking down on a 24yearold who cant drive which is why i got my license so in a way one anxiety helped me overcome another anxiety but my gosh i havent felt this alive this useless this human in all of my life while the anxiety i have about driving is still there its nice to know that i can actually do it,0
smelling my friends gfs vagina so like most this happened a couple weeks back i had a few friends over to swim and beforehand a couple of the girls used my bathroom to changeetc a few hours later everyone is getting ready to leave i hop in the shower real quick to wash off and since im already in there i decide to shave my face now i have to note that i use those womens schick hydro razors while they are technically a womens razor they are usually cheaper than mens razors and you can get a shitload of them at costco for pretty cheap so i shave hop out dry off and notice i missed a few hairs on my upper lip i grab the razor i have on the counter and as soon as i touch it to my face i notice a horrible smell it smelt sort of like bad fish almost how i would imagine the dumpster at a joes crab shack would smell being the only person that regularly uses this bathroom i assume the smell is linked to stale water left on the razor or something and i ignore it shortly after my friends girlfriend comes in the bathroom and says i hope you didnt just shave with that razor your mom gave it to me so i could shave my bikini area it took me a few seconds to process what she said and for some reason i denied using it as soon as she left the bathroom though i scrubbed the shit out of my face for a good five minutes with the hottest water possible i still havent told my friend about it i dont know what is worse that i know what my friends girlfriends vag smells like or that im aware of her poor womanly hygiene tldr the new schick hydro 5 now with bacterial vaginosis,0
being racist towards black cats obligatory this didnt happen today just got around to writing it okay so some context me and my parents found a starving black cat on the 19th while out for a walk weve found many cats before none have come close to the pitiful shape this one is in im talking concentration camp skinny when i reached down to touch her i burst into tears because it was so painful so its been a very intensely stressful couple of days worrying about this sweet kitty and having to keep her contained since we have 6 other cats and we cant risk her spreading disease if she has one she starts throwing up what shes eaten and i panic shes already so weak shes only walked a few feet at this point and its been two days so im shaking and freaking out and we go to the emergency vets we found her when every place is closed aside from there and its very expensive so we tried to hold off talking her we get there and my heads a buzz im socially awkward enough but im already attached to this cat and trying not to burst into tears so people are talking to me and im just delayed and not really thinking about what i say or do the vet can tell im visibly upset so she tries to make small talk and distract me were talking about our other pets and how we already have two other black cats i mention she looks just like one of them and was found on the same street so she might be related but instead of ending there i kept talking now im not one of those people who say all black cats look alike because they dont but and i realized what i said to the african american vet and i die inside i feel like a crushed soda can internally she knew i knew cringe long story short my dad made sure to roast me endlessly for that slip up and the kitty is okay right now shes currently eating and purring on my lap happy as can be im not sure ill make as a speedy a recovery as her though tldr found a starving cat took her to the vet and had a tobias funkeesque slip up where i ranted about how i think all black cats dont usually look alike to a black vet without realizing what i was saying,0

accidentally nutting on my own face throwaway because a few of my friends and family know my actual username and this was mortifying i dont need anyone i know in real life ever knowing about this im still in shock about it 2 days later and im just trying to laugh it off at this point but this fuck up takes place 2 days ago saturday night it had been a while since i last had sex went through quite a lengthy dry period roughly 8 months so obviously i was pretty excited overall the sex was great brought her back home after a night out we smoked a little weed and then started going at it i notice im more sensitive than i have ever felt before i associate this with the fact that i had not had sex in a long time and possibly the weed i cant say for sure though because before this i had never had sex whilst stoned before this was a bit annoying but nothing a little pacing and edging cant solve this plays a role later on in the story after about 10 minutes in bed we decide to move to the bathroom yes very classy i know just in case because i had a few friends sleeping outside and i didnt want to risk them walking in on us and locking the room door was just sketchy without going over the details were in the bathroom for 15 minutes and i feel myself about to ejaculate but despite my best efforts at pacing and edging i hit the point of no return i was sitting on a basket when this happened and i pulled out quite literally 05 seconds before i came and i managed to give myself a facial i was so shocked that for about 3 seconds i did nothing i was so shocked and needed a sec to briefly reflect on how i just managed to finish on my own face she burst into laughter as i began to collect my thoughts and wiped my face off in the end it actually didnt change her feelings towards me moreso solidified this image of me being a meme to her in her mind i came out of it with mass feelings of disgust as a guy the last thing you want on your face is semen embarrassment shame and any other synonyms that are relevant tldr had sex for the first time in a while finished on my own face by accident she laughed it off im here trying to console myself on reddit by typing it up,0

i could smell the hypocritical stench oozing out of his pores some guy came into the store i work at today and saw that we sell knives that were made in indiapakistan he started running his mouth about how they were cheap and people should just buy american i explained to him that its difficult for us as a small business to make a living on selling strictly american made items like knives because the cost of buying the items wholesale and then retailing them creates a very large price point for the customer who in most cases isnt interested in investing a ton of money into something like a pocket knife unless theyre serious collectors which most arent i told this gentleman that while our store does carry a large majority of items handcrafted right here in the state we do also carry imports in order to give the customer a more affordable souvenir to take home i told him that i always make an effort to distinguish the imports from the domestics and how they would need to be willing to spend the extra cash for the real deal but ironically most people balk at the prices of stuff made locally and go for the cheap imported shit he rambled on about how my opinion is wrong and that i wouldnt think the way i do if my work was being outsourced which was hilarious to me because right after he went on his rant he took a call from a friend on his iphone that was safely enclosed in its otterbox i laughed at him and said nice iphone to which he responded yeah made in china smartass,0

a year ago i survived may fifth 2017 i sat in a crowd with my graduating class we celebrated that the four short years we spent together would be ending soon i listened to fellow class mates give speeches about their families and friends looking at my classmates who packed the event with loved ones and sold out tables i compared my own situation i felt completely and entirely alone i was about to graduate high school i should have felt happy or relieved i felt terrified and bleak about my future i felt as if i had already thrown my life in the toilet i felt like i was just a shell of a person just hanging around i had struggled with suicidal thoughts from as young as i remember and that night the years of wussing out and failing were enough and this time i was going to do it my mom found me in my room the next day and left me alone in the hospital the hours that followed were the most painful and terrifying of my life i felt myself dying and instead of the peace i anticipated i felt intense fear the weeks that followed were some of the worst weeks of my life the main reason why i felt inspired to write is that i watched a buzzfeed video of someone who attempted suicide and survived he talked about how thankful he was every single day that he lived im sure thats the case for some people but that was not the case for me i felt even worse i thought that surviving this attempt and almost dying would have given me a new perspective on life it didnt i had to find this perspective myself there are still some days that i feel suicidal but i remember how scared and how horrible it was tl dr it has been over a year since i survived a suicide attempt it is so hard i just want everyone reading to know whether you survived an attempt or are considering suicide life gets better i know it seems bleak now believe me it gets better i too believed that i would feel horrible forever i felt the same as you please reach out to someone you can trust you deserve to stick around and be happy i love you have a good night please please be careful,1

just thinking boy is it longsorry as another hour clicks by ive been really starting wonder when the suicide entered my life the first time when i was old enough to understand was when my sister went to college and she was very depressed she came home on winter break she made a tape recording of herself which i found in her car i thought it was a music tape but it was her voice saying how she felt how she wished she had the nerve to jump off of the roof that she found access to how much of a failer she felt and how she said my mom and dad were making her feel like she wasnt trying hard enough i was 7 when i heard those words it broke my heart she still today doesnt know i found that tape from that moment on i worried terribly about her do i go to mom and dad what do i do well at that age i did what every kid would do not say anything to mom and dad but be with her every second i could i made it my mission to be with her constantly she made it through those difficult years she is very happy now with 2 kids and a loving husband but here i am going through some pretty heavy shit now my first suicide attempt was when i was 23 second one was about7 years ago and now here i am thinking you know its just not worth it anymore its too much effort to even breath now i ended a very abusive relationship and it sucks having to go around living in this much pain day in and fucking day out whats wrong with me what in my head is broken im not looking to blame anyone but trying to grab the brass ring of hope do i get suicidal because i was exposed to that world at such a young age why does it hurt so bad i remember asking for help when i was starting to become unstable and my mom said that i wasnt going to go to talk with someone cause it would look bad on her what would the family think and that i was silly for thinking the way i do now she has past and now i feel ashamed of myself i have deep trust issues and i dont know who to reach out to i have a psychiatrist but i have such deep trust problems he probably wouldnt want to hear it anyway well thanks all anyones insight will be greatly considered,1

im suicidal when im not high how to improve my natural state,1
okay so he isnt my so and our relationship isnt romantic whatsoever but i feel like this frienship is toxic do i end it okay so i have a friend met through my ex who i think lies to me all the time and im not sure if im being too harsh as i dont think i want to be friends with him anymore at times i know things are definite lies for example one tuesday he messaged saying he was trying to get his cat into a bag and then the next day he messaged me saying his mum abuses his cat amd shes ran away and has been missimg for 3 days so obviously he was lying about one of those things he doesnt get along with his mum and always tries to paint her in a bad light because apparently shes a bitch but i feel like he migjt lie about that too for attention and even if she is a bitch he doesnt help himself with the situation and makes himself vulnerable to her time after time by doing nice thimgs for her amd then complains when she doesnt appreciate it which she never has done so i dunno why he keeps doing it so i cant really sympathise with him about that i feel like he lies for attention and sympathy and when he comes to me with real problems i can never tell if hes telling the truth as ive noticed lots of his stories dont coincide so i cant bring myself to sympathise as a lot of the time i feel like its a lie and id just be wasting my time esp as when i try amd help him he changes the topic and complains about something else or says he doesnt wanna talk about it or he just ignores my response and basically repeats himself agaim showing that he doesnt want to be helped another lie i think hes told is when i told him i had pcos a few months ago and he told me the girl hes constantly on and off with has it too and misses a lot of periods too but then not long ago he told me that that girl could possibly be pregnant with another guys kid as shes missed a period so i was like well tell her not to worry as missed periods are really common with people who have pcos and a lot of the time its hard to get oregnant if you have it and he just said what or something like that so i said you told me she had pcos a few months ago and he was like no i didnt i domt know what that it is or something like that so theres a perfect example of him lying again and brushing stuff off when i sort of question him about stuff its so infuriating hes also very passive aggressive with me when i dont pay him enough attention and when i dont open his messages hell message on numerous platforms or spams me with messages until i reply and if ive told him i dont to hang hell say somethinf like can i pinch some baccy as ive ran out and im close by and then he ends up staying for 34 hours i feel like this is a really unhealthy relationship and unconventional way to act with a friend but im not sure if thats just me being cold hearted another alarmimg thing is that hes lost so many friendships alarming number over time and i know people lose friends with age but surely if its that many maybe he was the problem he loves to complain about people using him etc and how people hurt him constantly but he just sticks himself in those situations so again i cant sympathise with him as ive also been there but ive learnt my lesson one other thing thats really bothered me is that hes told me about his health and stuff and how hes constantly in and out of hospital and seeing doctors etc but he wont tell me why and of course i worry as im human and he knows how to tug at my heart strings as he knows im very sympathetic and have a big heart not bragging i hate it its gotten me into shit situations and because of the lack of info he gives me i feel like he lies about it for attention cause why bring it up if you dont want to talk about it but then i guess sometimes you just dont wanna talk about things and its understandable but what made me think that he was lying about this was the fact that he seems to be able to see the doctorget a hospital appointment straight away whenever he wants needs one and not saying hes unimportant but surely unless they are in critical condition surely you wouldnt be able to get an appointment at the click of your fingers but maybe thats just me being paranoid because hes lied about other stuff he also complains about how all the girls he dates at the same time are crazy bitches and wont accept that hes probably been a dick to them and their actions are most probably justified as if he acts the way he does with me with them id be the exact same lol but i dunno how to tell him this without being mean ive never had to break up with a friend as ive never come across someone whos acted like this with me before and im not sure whether i should give him a chance because he is nice to me most the time and is supportive at times but thats stopped now as ive needed some time to myself and cant reply to him 247 and i just feel like im mentally drained after seeingtalking to him or do i just tell him i dont wanna be friends with him cause of x y and z and see what his response is and go from there or do i just act like nothing is wrong and let it fizzle out and if i should break it off how do i it also im not the only person whos noticed hes a bit odd and lies a lot a few friends hes met through me have mentioned something to me without me saying anything first which shows that im not just being paranoid tldr basically ive caught a friend out for lying before which makes me believe he lies about other stuff and i dunno whether to end our friendship or do i just give him the benefit of the doubt,0

this is either a fucked up love letter or a potential suicide note tldr first half is mostly impulse rambling but its less suicidal by the end parts unrequited love sucks you know who you are this thing in my head keeps growing and i cant get rid of it if i have to wait too much longer i know itll kill me i cant wait it out i dont know how i swear i cant breathe please help you dont care i wanna die i want to end me but i dont wanna die i need you here to tell me its okay youve kept me breathing before its why i feel so safe with you you dont care i cant fix it you wont let me youre the only person alive that means something my whole world you said it once your world you loved me once and i want that again you were afraid wed grow apart and then you just stopped i wanted to try im still desperately trying i want you to try it hurts it wont stop it wont stop and i just wanna love you with everything i have you dont care please dont throw me away i want it to stop but i understand how this feels now to want to die thinking of ways to do it shutting people out the apathy drowning i get it and i want to keep trying to be better to be your whole world all over again i keep the ring but i dont wear it to think it means nothing at all after the promise you made before you had to leave you said it would be worth it i believed that and i waited for you i know it was hell but you made it out 2 months later i was damn happy to hug you again and cry into you like you were the only man standing it was hell to let you go a second time i still waited and then you came back for good finally then you started to push me away i know you were struggling with other things i remember the first time you came over to break things off i didnt react well i thought that was it but you were brave to approach me directly i was almost okay with letting you go because you gave it to me straight you needed time so i stayed silent even though i couldnt sleep but you came back the next night to say that you fucked up and that you still loved me and i was so relieved that maybe i could help you through things because i wanna support you however i can but im shit at talking i dont know i wasnt enough so you cut me off anyways you quit talking altogether i panicked im prone to that and the only way i knew how to cope was to solve the problem false hope tends to keep me above water but only for so long it just gets worse now because the thought of you with anyone but me makes my stomach drop and my heart shatter into pieces and theres no way out i cant breathe anymore you dont care do you love her already its easier to be jealous i think anger replacing emptiness but this burning sensation in my head always comes back and wraps me up suffocating me in it im obsessive dramatic crazy whatever im just crazy shitbonkers for you in particular so i thought it would last but i never wanted to put this much pressure on you like shit i need more friends i just hate people and dont connect easily introvertproblems so yeah i still have a lot of growing up to do youve shown me that at least and that maybe i can be an adult for once but still im not gonna be just that crazy ex girlfriend that never got over you its bullshit as if at one point you didnt want to spend the rest of your life with me you brought it up first and i was all onboard even if it wouldnt be for a while and the night you brought up the big l word with me is still my favorite memory right up there with you proposing i know when id miss you the most id replay it in my head i dont know how much it means for you but it means a lot to me with that said im aware i cant just change your feelings but this way i can at least explain mine to the fullest extent that i can without bombarding your phone with my bullshit and expecting an answer on the spot not one of my brighter methods of communication honestly but thats what i got for now,1

my final goodbyeits come to my realization recently there is an almost zero chance that i will ever have the life that ive been trying to manifest for the last decade and im simply not okay with that im no closer to success today than i was 20 years ago and im not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me its become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit i am so tired of struggling always having nothing ive been in debt literally my entire adult life even with two bankruptcies i cant seem to get my shit together every time i try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me i will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what i do to try im so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that its been literally my entire fucking life i dont remember a time that i wasnt in debt and i dont remember a time that i havent been stressed about finances it seems as though that the universe has decided without me that i am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much i want it or how hard i try for it about a year ago i had what i would call a spiritual awakening a realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary i believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before were born the bonds we create on earth are actually created long before were ever even conceived we all have a predestine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission ive had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life many of which i have completely fucked up beyond what i can ever recover from ive done stupid things said stupid things and ive hurt people that i was supposed to walk this life with its unfortunate because i know i could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support i just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point time for a reset please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me couldve done to prevent this literally nothing so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of i shouldve or couldve or wouldve done something had i only known how bad he was im so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews i promise that no matter what i will always look out for all of you from the other side i love you r ps please do not have a funeral for me i dont want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life also i wouldnt bother dealing with the cra or the bankruptcy youll only find insurmountably crushing debt thats pretty much unerasable anyway believe me ive tried im so sorry if my passing has caused any financial strain to anybody i have nothing to offer financially but maybe you can sell some of my belongings to cover any expenses that come up from this again im so sorry i just cant live like this anymore,1

using fixaflat well this just happenedwoke up this morning and noticed that the drivers side rear tire was flat on the minivan as i was on my way to work i didnt have time to deal with it at the moment so hopped in the car and went into the officebusy day at the office i called the wife and let her know id be home at lunch to get things taken care of on my way home for lunch i stopped at the local walmart to grab a can of fixaflat for those that dont know its an aerosol can you can hook up to your tire and inflate it also contains a foam like compound that will temp sealpath any holes up to a 14 diameter according to the can this cost about 9 after tax i chose to go this route vs using the spare to try and save time as well as the van being parked on an incline i didnt want to move it on the rim and risk further damage to the tire or the rim itself so i figured hey lets give this a try and see how it works so i get home grab a bite to eat while going over the directions again to ensure i understand the procedure once comfortable with the steps i go outside hook the can up to the tire and press the button voila tire is inflated enough to move and were ready to take it to the shop for complete repair after finding the cause of the flat a large nail in the tread i follow the wife to the tire shop about 2 miles away talk to the guy at the front desk and let him know i needed a flat repair he quoted the cost at about 2030 which was expected as hes typing my info into the computer he asks if we had any other questions thats when i casually mention that i threw in a can of fixaflat to limp us to the shopyou could instantly see that there was a problem by the look on his face right before he says ohhhhunfortunately we cant repair it after thats been used the goo inside is extremely hard to clean out and causes issues with plugspatches pretty much already knowing the answer i ask what options i have and of course the answer is replace the tire he then follows that up with they should really be putting a label on the can that lets people know this and my response was yeah no shit i call around to 45 other shops and get the same answer turns out no one is willing to touch a tire after this stuff has been used so now my vehicle is sitting down at a tire shop waiting to get the whole thing replaced in the end im looking at 170 or so because of a nail and my lack of research ahead of time looking at the fixaflat faq on their website i see the following frequently asked questions after using fixaflat can my tire be repaired yes there is nothing in the formulation that would prevent a tire from being repaired advise the tire repair professional that you have used fixaflat brand tire inflator in your tire so they may properly clean the tire for repair fixaflat cleans up easily with soapy water and a shop rag warranties vary by tire manufacturer contact your tire manufacturer for specific details so yeah that is completely false really wish i would have known this before making this costly mistake had i done some more google searching i probably would have found other people mentioning this but i just didnt have time and needed to get the car back on the road so anyway my mistake is your gain dont use fixaflat unless its an emergency and you have no other option tldr used a 9 can of fixaflat to temporarily repair a flat tire learned that tire repair shops wont repair tires that have fixaflat in them which resulted in replacing the whole tire costing me 170 instead of the just 2030 for a standard patchrepair,0
jennifer egans _goon squad_ and thuggin on nostalgia ive recently read several reviews of this book which all criticized it for its unusual form complaints ranged from the trite dont call it a novel if its really an anthology to the prescriptive i wish we had followed a certain character longer personally i didnt have a problem with the fact that this was all vignettes i read it as performing the phenomenon of experience mediated by the passage of time the way we think about our own lives is very rarely sequential and i think egans semiarbitrary starting and stopping points were meant to reflect that many of the stories dont even take place primarily in the present tense instead foregrounding large tracts of text where the characters use whatever is immediately present in their lives as a sort of springboard for meandering examinations of the critical path that has brought them to that point or in one case of peculiar thirdperson omniscience where their path will take them in the future what struck me as much more of a cheat was the wistful mistyeyed nostalgiatinted sentimentality of many of the chapters not only is using nostalgia as an end run to make a piece of writing more heartfelt than it would otherwise be a bit de rigeur it hides a sort of nefarious implication that lifes meaning is to be found by looking backwards over our shoulders at whats already transpired even as we collectively and blindly stumble forward but is that really so surely theres a sort of aura of heroism which surrounds people who can unselfconsciously embrace the present or god forbid see the uncertain potentiality of the future as being fat and lush with possibility but thats just me if you ever catch me staring into space all glassyeyed im probably day dreaming about my plans for the future what about you which was your favourite squaddie to read about,0
i got laid off today but am feeling super pumped about it i was working on commission and recently not making that much money so my boss was really doing me a favor lifes been happening ive been living more spiritually and my creative passion projects have been winning my focus and attention i felt shocked and sad hearing the news but i also felt happy and liberated and immediately went to a center to help young entrepreneurs start their own business id ultimately be doing the same thing except working for someone whom i actually respect its a move id thought about making for months now the news this morning just shoved me hard in that direction im scared for a lot of new challenges but am very hopeful and confident in my abilities i guess the high im on feels very odd and i want to be cautious as financially i only have a couple months to figure things out spiritually im happy but my analytical brain is biting its nails clean off tldr this is my first time getting laid off is there a common process that happens of highs and lows thanks for reading,0

ive been lying to myself my entire life and ive only just realized it over the past year a tumultuous relationship has been the dominating center of my existence at the core of it i know that i am madly in love with this amazing woman who has tirelessly shown me the deepest love ive ever known that core is wrapped in infidelity dishonesty anger and resentment for a long time i blamed her much of our troubles could be easily chalked upat a shallow level to her jealousy and impassioned backlash something i did express to more than one person when i was frustrated with our situation i cheated on her i kept other women on the sideline constantly in contact seeking attention distraction and cheap entertainment when i wanted it she caught me i told her it would never happen again it happened again no matter what i promised there was always another line that i would cross another inappropriate message id send another advance i wouldnt completely brush aside at first i couldnt explain it other than simple lust i couldnt provide a satisfactory reason for my actions i broke up with her a few times we fought a hundred times somehow we always came back together sometimes the connection was bordering on bizarre we often commented if either of us believed in universal interference or supreme beings that something kept pushing us back together over the last year shes worked to peel back the cover tried to help me she just wanted to know why wanted to know it wouldnt happen again over the last week she stripped the final layer i feel naked weak and vulnerable i havent slept much this weekend maybe a few hours with the help of a lot of weed but i also feel an understanding i have been for most of my life some toxic demonstration of fake it til you make it i was so ashamed of uncomfortable with myself that i didnt feel i could show anyone who i was nobody liked him when i was 17 i found alcohol and i felt closer started smoking weed shortly after and boy was i cool at 18 someone showed me oxycontin too expensive for the average party goer this was an elite buzz and i had a great hookup perfect for an ego chasing an image by 20 most of my friends were in jail rehab or buried i thankfully escaped any longlasting consequence and quit pills cold turkey moved across the country to attend a tech school and start over felt really good for a minute im 10 years into a career in show production im really good at my job but i often feel inadequate and am always conscious of those more advanced or more experienced than i while that can be a good thing i allowed it be a motivator of selfcontempt i began to play up my role sometimes when telling stories of things ive done in my career ive done enough actually crazy unique and interesting things that i can really sell you whatever inflated story i want im a good liar someone told me about tinder i wish that fucking app had never been created if that app had a high score board i can almost guarantee id be on it the ability to present myself however i wanted from the comfort of my own home i rarely needed to buy more than 3 drinks at the bar before closing the deal at that point the purpose is served and i rarely contacted any of these women a second time i met the love of my life september of 2017 wed met before but in passing and interactions were enjoyable but brief this time it was charged electric exciting our first date a day of hiking and exploring small towns in the area was one of the best days ive ever had over the last year ive hurt her more times than i can count to feed my ego to conceal my own insecurity to fuel my own misplaced vanity i sacrificed the wellbeing of the one person who tried to make me truly happy im shocked at myself realizing and finally seeing myself in real light for the first time in a long time maybe ever ive been a fucking monster im so grateful to her she stuck by my side through all of it she helped me see i dont know whats going to happen but im not letting it go to waste no matter if i have to charge into my future alone i will not allow myself to repeat this cycle any further i have a chance to show her that her efforts were not in vain that i can be better that it was a part a characteristic of me but it will not be any more i dont deserve her god id do anything for her though,0
